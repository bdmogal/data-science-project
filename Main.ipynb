      "The ORR of the lenvatinib combination (lenvatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor) was largely similar to that of the \"A+T\" combination (bevacizumab and atelelizumab). The disease control rate (DCR) for the combination of lenvatinib was 88%, demonstrating the efficacy of lenvatinib in combination with immunotherapy. However, progression to second-line therapy after first-line treatment for advanced HCC still faces many challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our clinical practice and review of the literature, we focused on lenalidomide showing some efficacy in second-line treatment of advanced HCC. Lenalidomide is a new generation derivative of thalidomide, which has dual anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory anti-tumor effects. Lenalidomide may have the potential to reverse drug resistance and increase the efficacy of synergistic immune-targeted therapy. Based on the preliminary data of its effectiveness in the second-line treatment of advanced HCC alone or in combination with TKI, we propose to conduct a prospective, exploratory, single-arm, open, multicenter phase II clinical study of advanced HCC PD-1 inhibitor in combination with lenvatinib after progression of first-line treatment, to initially evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has entered a new phase of clinical research and patient outcomes with the continued availability of new targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors. More notable are lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 inhibitor regimens and the data that continue to emerge from these studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2020 ASCO GI published the Study117, a phase Ib clinical study of lenvatinib in combination with Nivolumab for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocytes. The study was an open phase Ib study that enrolled 30 patients, 17 with BCLC- stage B and 13 with BCLC- stage C. In the ITT population, the median age of patients was 70 years (range: 36-81 years) and 24 (80%) were male. 28 patients with ECOG performance status of ECOG 0 and 1 patient with ECOG 2 were enrolled. Enrolled patients received lenvatinib 12 mg (weight ≥60 kg) or 8 mg (weight <60 kg) orally once daily and in combination with Nivolumab 240 mg intravenously once every 2 weeks. The study results were impressive, with an investigator-assessed overall complete remission rate of 10% CR, a partial remission rate of 66.7% PR, an objective remission rate of 76.7% ORR, and a disease control rate of 96.7% DCR.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, there are still many challenges in progressing to second-line therapy after first-line treatment for advanced HCC. The first is the limited efficacy of second-line treatment options recommended by NCCN guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RESORCE study showed that single-agent regorafenib after sorafenib failure treated patients with Child-Pugh class A liver function had a higher mOS (10.6 months vs. 7.8 months) and mPFS (3.1 months vs. 1.5 months) than the placebo group. the CELESTIAL study showed that single-agent cabozantinib for patients previously treated with sorafenib in patients with HCC who were eligible for progression after at least first-line systemic therapy, 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either cabozantinib (60 mg, QD) or placebo. OS was significantly longer in the cabozantinib group (10.2 months vs. 8.0 months, P=0.005). mPFS was 5.2 months vs. 1.9 months, respectively (P<0.001); ORR was 4% and <1%, respectively (P=0.009). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global phase III clinical study of advanced HCC patients with elevated AFP after first-line failure of sorafenib enrolled 292 HCC patients with failed sorafenib and baseline AFP ≥ 400ng/ml who were randomized to receive either Ramucirumab (8mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Compared with placebo, ramolutumab improved patients' mOS (8.5 months vs. 7.3 months, P=0.019 9) and mPFS (2.8 months vs. 1.6 months, P<0.0001) and reduced the risk of death by 29%; while ORR was 4.6% and 1.1%, respectively (P=0.115 6).The CheckMate-040 study [ 7] opened a phase II study of a dual immune combination therapy strategy with Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab) for the second-line treatment of advanced HCC, enrolling patients with advanced HCC intolerant or progressing on sorafenib therapy, with 33% (16/49; 95% CI 20 to 48) responding to immune combination therapy; BICR was assessed according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with 8% (4 /49) achieved CR and 24% (12/49) PR; DOR ranged from 4.6 months to 30.5 months, of which 88% lasted at least 6 months, 56% at least 12 months, and 31% at least 24 months. However, all of the above studies were done after failure of sorafenib alone, and there are no effective treatment options for progression beyond targeted combination immunotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the higher ORR of lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 antibody and the absence of risk of lethal bleeding, lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 antibody for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is used by most physicians in real-world applications in China with good results, but there is no effective second-line treatment option for patients who fail lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 antibody, so our study explores whether lenalidomide can reverse lenvatinib patients who are resistant to lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 antibodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phase II clinical study by the Brown University Oncology Group showed that lenalidomide was used as second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with 6 of 40 patients (15%) having a partial response and 2 patients (5%) having progression-free survival of 36 and 32 months, respectively, with a median progression-free survival of 3.6 months and a median overall survival of 7.6 months. Lenalidomide is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis [8]. A study in Taiwan found lenalidomide to be active in patients with advanced HCC with a good safety profile. The remission rate of advanced HCC progressing on lenalidomide monotherapy with sorafenib was 13% and the disease control rate was 53%. the 6-month progression-free survival rate was 9.1%. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.8 months and 8.9 months, respectively. Early AFP response was significantly associated with higher disease control (76% vs 22%, P=0.001) and longer progression-free survival (P=0.020) . A study showed that apatinib combined with lenalidomide for advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma improved treatment outcome and quality of life, with an overall effective rate of 89.7% vs 79.6% in the apatinib combined with lenalidomide treatment group compared to the apatinib alone group, respectively (P<0.01), while reducing the incidence of proteinuria, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and malaise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenalidomide, a new generation derivative of thalidomide, has dual anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory antitumor effects . Lenalidomide binds to its substrate CRBN and forms a copolymer with ubiquitinase E3, which degrades lymphocyte development-related tumor factors IKZF 1 and IKZF 3 through ubiquitination. degradation of IKZF 1 inhibits the binding of downstream substrate IRF4 to Myc and its expression, thus achieving antitumor effects; degradation of IKZF3 factor promotes the proliferation of effector T cells and NK cells and induces the secretion of anti-tumor factors such as IFNγ by effector T cells and NK cells. The degradation of IKZF3 factor can promote the proliferation of effector T cells and NK cells, and can induce the secretion of anti-tumor factors such as IFNγ by effector T cells and NK cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have confirmed that lenalidomide can reverse PD-1 inhibitor resistance, and a study from the group of Cang Yong at the University of Science and Technology Shanghai found that PD-1 inhibitors require CD28 co-stimulatory receptors to promote CD8+ T cell activity and cytotoxicity. However, during depleted T cells and immune senescence, CD28 expression is frequently inactivated leading to PD-1 inhibitor resistance, which limits the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapy. This study shows that lenalidomide restores the antitumor activity of cd28 -deficient CD8+ T cells after PD-1 resistance. Lenalidomide can target CRBN ubiquitin ligase to degrade Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 in T cells and release paracrine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and intracellular Notch signaling that are required to activate CD8+ T cells in tumors and inhibit tumor growth via PD-1 blockade. The findings suggest that PD-1 immunotherapy of solid tumors in a CD28- T cell infiltration-rich state could benefit from a combination of lenalidomide reversal of drug resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the above, we believe that lenalidomide may have the potential to reverse drug resistance and increase efficacy with synergistic immune-targeted therapy. Based on its preliminary efficacy data in second-line treatment of advanced HCC alone or in combination with TKI, we propose to conduct a prospective, exploratory, single-arm, open, multicenter phase II clinical study of advanced HCC PD-1 inhibitor in combination with lenvatinib after progression to first-line therapy plus lenalidomide to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen.\n",

      "In order to investigate the effects of collagen wound dressing on colonic anastomosis during colectomy, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. The goal of study was to determine whether the use of collagen wound dressing results in improving clinical outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Wound healing occurs in four distinct phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Numerous factors can influence these phases, which can be classified as either local or systemic. Local factors include infection, presence of foreign bodies, inadequate oxygenation, and other issues affecting the wound itself, while systemic factors encompass a wide range of considerations such as age, gender, presence of systemic disease, ischemia, stress, medication use, obesity, cigarette and alcohol use, nutritional status, and immunocompromised conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anastomotic healing in the colon is similar to the healing process in skin while there's still some differences. While the cellular and histological processes involved in colonic healing are well known, the pathophysiological process is not fully understood and requires further studies . Unlike skin healing, the process of patients undergoing colonic resection and anastomosis healing can only be inferred by observing certain parameters, such as amount of drainage, time to first flatus and defecation and the patient's symptoms. These parameters are used to guide the patient's recovery program. Complications such as anastomotic leakage, bleeding or stricture would lead to longer hospital stay, mortality and morbidity. The most devastating one is anastomotic leakage. Although we have found some strategies to lower the rate in colorectal surgery such as colon preparation or antibiotics administration, the leakage still bothers a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides controlling the local and systemic factors, several biomaterial products have been designed to progress the healing. Collagen plays crucial roles in all of the four healing phases. As a result, collagen wound dressing, derived from bovine, equine, avian or porcine, has been applied in different sites of wound to promote healing. Several studies have concluded that collagen wound dressing resulted in better outcomes but limited to in vitro studies or animal based research. Pantelis D. concluded that fibrin in combination with the collagen patch can improve healing in high-risk mice that underwent colonic anastomosis surgery. Pommergaard HC. also concluded that the collagen wound dressing can lower the leakage rate in mouse colon anastomosis surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another limitation is that most studies have small sample sizes and lack of long term observation. Parker et al designed a non-randomized study and concluded that collagen wound dressing is safe and easy to apply in human colorectal surgery. Marano et al compared the complication rate of two cohorts and revealed that collagen wound dressing can lower the complication rate in the patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal surgery. As of now, it is premature to conclude that collagen wound dressing is effective in human colonic anastomosis due to the lack of human studies and larger sample size. In order to investigate the effects of collagen wound dressing on colonic anastomosis during colectomy, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. Our goal was to determine whether the use of collagen wound dressing results in improving clinical outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy.\n",

      "This study is design to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of Fruquintinib combined with Serplulimab in first-line treatment of non-clear renal cell carcinoma. Fruquintinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, is an anticancer drug independently developed in China to treat refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This is a Single-arm, multicenter, prospective phase 2 clinical study.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "The study is ongoing. This is a single-arm, multicenter clinical study enrolling 39 patients with metastatic or unresectable nccRCC at Renji Hospital and Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai, China. The study is divided into a safety-run-in stage and a cohort expansion stage. Six patients were enrolled in the safety-run-in stage, and no dose-limited toxicity or treatment-related deaths occurred within the 28-day observation period. Consequently, the cohort was expanded to 39 patients. The treatment includes Fruquintinib 5mg, qd, 2w on/1w off, combined with Serplulimab 4.5mg/kg, IV drip, d1, q3w. Tumor response is evaluated at baseline, every 6 weeks during treatment, and at end-of-treatment visit.\n",

      "The role of frontline therapy of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is controversial. We aim to conduct this prospective study to observe the efficacy and safety of ASCT as frontline therapy in DLBCL patients with high-risk disease, defined by an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score equal to or greater than three.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "There is evidence to suggest that chemotherapy followed by ASCT may be more effective than standard chemotherapy alone as a frontline treatment for high-risk DLBCL patients. However, the use of ASCT as frontline therapy for DLBCL remains controversial due to concerns over the potential toxicities of the procedure, as well as questions about which patients would benefit most from this approach.\n",

      "We aim to conduct this prospective study to observe the efficacy and safety of ASCT as frontline therapy in DLBCL patients with high-risk disease, defined by an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score equal to or greater than 3 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients diagnosed with DLBCL and an IPI score of equal to or greater than three will be eligible for inclusion in this study, provided they consent to receive the standard R-CHOP, i.e. rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, and prednisone regimen, followed by ASCT. During the interim evaluation, patients achieving complete response (CR) as determined by computed tomography (CT), or complete metabolic response (CMR) as determined by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), will be followed up for up to two years after completing the R-CHOP regimen followed by ASCT. Patients achieving partial response (PR) as determined by CT, or partial metabolic response (PMR) as determined by PET-CT, and who are willing to receive Pola-R-CHP as the following treatment regimen followed by ASCT with Pola-BEAM as conditioning regimen, will also be followed up for up to two years. Patients achieving less than a PR or PMR response will be excluded from the study.\n",

      "Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that severely impacts a person's ability to regulate their emotions. This loss of emotional control can increase impulsivity, affect how a person feels about themselves, and negatively impact their relationships with others. In fact, the societal impact of BPDs might be found in emotional suffering, disability and economic burden. In addition in BPD, the suicide rate might be as high as 8-10%. the presence of BPD also interferes with response to treatment of physical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as migraine, HIV, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Furthermore, BPD in particular, are associated with high rates of unemployment, absences from work and inefficiency at work, with only 25% of patients suffering from BPD working full time and 40% receiving disability payments. Accordingly, early detection and management would be of great societal and economic impact. Our Study aim is to validate the Arabic version of Maclean Instrument for screening and detection of BPD and and investigate the possible risk factors associated with that disease\n",

      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health problem that affects the way you feel about yourself and others, the way you think , difficulty in managing behavior and emotions, self-image issues and a pattern of relationships that are unstable. BPD patients frequently describe their life as unpredictable and stressful. As stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image and effect, as well as marked impulsivity. This condition arises in early adulthood or adolescence, leading to severe functional impairment and subjective discomfort. Unfortunately, diagnosis and treatment of BPD is often delayed, leading to a less favorable outcome. This is especially true in patients with early onset BPD, in whom the detection and subsequent therapeutic intervention on the disorder is usually further put off. Indeed, in the last two decades, there has been a great sensibilization towards personality disorder (PD)diagnosis in adolescence, reflected in the significant increase in empirical studies regarding this matter, and in the legitimization of adolescent PD diagnosis in psychiatric nomenclature (DSM-5 and ICD-11), as well as in national treatment guidelines in the UK and Australia. Nonetheless, a recent review by Sharp has stressed how scientific evidence and national practice guidelines are yet to penetrate routine clinical care. Indeed, in common clinical practice diagnosis and consequently, treatment of BPD is usually delayed due to underestimation of symptoms and, often, hesitation to diagnose this disorder in younger individuals. BPD is progressively considered a life expectancy formative disorder that exists on a layered continuum of severity. The recent studies for the adults who have BDP disease couldn't find a pharmacological treatment for them. The symptoms treatment with pharmacotherapy is not accurate for the treatment of BDP in adults, the pharmacotherapy should not be used for adolescent BPD. The only study exist is about the using of omega-3 fatty acids and the increase risk of psychosis. Overall, there is no pharmacological treatment for the BDP disease for adults, also the risks of iatrogenic and poly-pharmacy toxicity is high in these young people. The other comorbidities of the disease are treated from the clinical for adolescents, using the pharmacological therapy when needed. Our study aim is to validate the Arabic version of Maclean Instrument for screening and detection of BPD and and investigate the possible risk factors associated that disease thus decreasing the societal and economic burden of that disease\n",

      "Many post COVID-19 patients suffer from cognitive deficits, even after 1 year after hospitalization. These complaints have a huge impact on psychological well-being and quality of life. In rehabilitation programs in the Netherlands, most interventions are based on physical therapy or learning how to cope with fatigue and low levels of energy. In former studies computerized training of cognition in other populations has been proven to be effective. Knowledge on the effect of computerized training on attention and working memory in patients suffering from COVID-19 is urgently needed, and may contribute to more evidence-based rehabilitation programs for these patients. Therefore the effectiveness of computerized training of attention and working memory in post COVID-19 patients with cognitive complaints will be studied in this study.\n",

      "Since 2019, the world has been overwhelmed by COVID-19, a respiratory infectious disease. Current evidence suggests that approximately 10%-20% of people experience symptoms of post COVID-19 condition. Many post COVID-19 victims suffer from fatigue, cognitive deficits and / or subjective cognitive complaints, even after 1 year after hospitalization. Detailed research shows deficits in attention, both in sustained and executive components. Furthermore, less capacity of working memory, inhibition deficits and lower information processing speed is frequently reported. Fatigue and cognitive impairment have been consistently reported to be some of the most common and debilitating features of post COVID-19 condition. Like fatigue, cognitive complaints are associated with anxiety and depression and have an impact on every day functioning, return to work and account for diminished health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). There are no established and effective treatments yet for these patients. In former studies computerized training in other populations has been proven to be effective. Knowledge on the effect of computerized training on attention and working memory in patients suffering from COVID-19 is urgently needed, and may contribute to more evidence-based rehabilitation programs.\n",

      "According to the comprehensive evaluation, the completion of vaccination and the prevention and treatment strategy of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine have obvious advantages in improving the symptoms of infection in patients with autoimmune diseases, shortening the course of disease and controlling disease activity, and can play a positive role in the whole process of epidemic prevention and treatment. Now we plan to conduct multi-center clinical and basic research to observe the preventive effect and safety of the vaccine on COVID-19, as well as the preventive effect of the combination of traditional Chinese medicine, in order to obtain high-quality evidence-based evidence and provide scientific basis for the clinical value of the drug.\n",

      "Autoimmune diseases are disorders of the body's immune function, involving multiple organs and tissues of the whole body, and characterized by a variety of specific or non-specific autoantibodies and inflammatory factors overexpression. However, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, patients with autoimmune diseases, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, face a high burden of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and are at higher risk for severe infection and disease progression. At present, patients with autoimmune diseases should give priority to the prevention and treatment strategy of COVID-19, among which the vaccination of novel coronavirus vaccine is the most important means to actively build herd immunity and control the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia, and the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine is an essential and effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection. According to the comprehensive evaluation, the completion of vaccination and the prevention and treatment strategy of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine have obvious advantages in improving the symptoms of infection in patients with autoimmune diseases, shortening the course of disease and controlling disease activity, and can play a positive role in the whole process of epidemic prevention and treatment. Now we plan to conduct multi-center clinical and basic research to observe the preventive effect and safety of the vaccine on COVID-19, as well as the preventive effect of the combination of traditional Chinese medicine, in order to obtain high-quality evidence-based evidence and provide scientific basis for the clinical value of the drug.\n",

      "Severe loneliness is a large and growing clinical and societal problem. Although there are interventions for loneliness, elevated levels often remain. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention to alleviate social and emotional loneliness among students. The second aim is to obtain effect sizes that inform sample size calculations of a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT). The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the feasibility and acceptability of a group intervention aimed at reducing social and emotional loneliness and social isolation in students. In addition, we want to obtain effect sizes that can inform the sample size calculation of a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypotheses are that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants after completing the SA-CBT protocol have reduced levels of social and emotional loneliness and social isolation compared to baseline (primary outcomes).\n",
      "Participants after completing the SA-CBT protocol have reduced levels of social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and better daily functioning compared to baseline (secondary outcomes).\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the SA-CBT intervention starts, participants will first follow a baseline period, ranging between 1 and 7 weeks. The length of the baseline period is based on the date of enrolment and therefore not random. Following the baseline period, all participants will start in the SA-CBT intervention. This intervention aims to encourage social behavioural activation tailored to the values of the participant and teach skills that make negative emotions and thoughts less bothersome and reduce feelings of loneliness. This intervention consists of seven weekly group sessions and a booster session. SA-CBT is offered in a group format to maximize possibilities for interpersonal therapeutic practise and is framed as a psycho-educational course to increase its acceptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data are collected at screening, pre-test, post-test, one-month follow-up and three-month follow-up, as well as during weekly measurements during the waiting list period and the course. Primary outcome measures are social and emotional loneliness and social isolation. Secondary outcome measures are social anxiety, depression, and daily functioning. Other outcome measures are interpersonal problems and assessment of the sessions.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an outsized impact on individuals with underlying social and medical vulnerability, leading to increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in these groups. Participants with underlying immune compromise, such as those with multiple myeloma, represent one such group. The advent of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has significantly limited morbidity and mortality across all groups, but the effectiveness of vaccination in individuals who are less likely to mount sufficient antibody response is uncertain. For this reason, booster vaccines have been recommended for those with underlying immune compromise. However, several key gaps remain in our understanding of how to best protect these individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a dearth of real-world evidence about the effectiveness of vaccination and boosters in patients who are immunocompromised, and very little information specifically about the recently approved mRNA boosters. Additionally, rates of vaccination and booster uptake in the United States remain low. A rapid, decentralized method of ascertaining information related to booster vaccine response and adverse events related to vaccines and COVID-19 infection is critical not only to answer questions about the booster vaccines, but to develop an infrastructure for answering similar questions about future vaccines or other diseases.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "The purpose of this project is to implement and establish the feasibility of a decentralized real-world evidence study network for patients with multiple myeloma and to monitor outcomes related to COVID-19 infection in this immunosuppressed population. Subjects with multiple myeloma will be invited to participate. The electronic portal will handle all consenting activities. Participants will be asked to complete specific study procedures electronically, including permission for electronic health record (EHR) data transfer. Participants will be asked to complete electronic questionnaires periodically.\n",

      "Postoperative pain treatment should be multimodal and opioid sparing. Thoracic epidural analgesia could relieve pain after laparoscopic surgery. Although ERAS guidelines suggest to use less invasive pain relieve technique, opioids are widely used perioperatively, despite of their side effects. Non-opioids and 5% lidocaine patches, used topicaly, could effectively reduce opioid consumption and their side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namely, efficient perioperative pain treatment is important to prevent late neuropathic pain, also after laparoscopic lower abdominal surgery. Its incidence is usually low compared to open surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of present study was to evaluate, if opioid consumption in laparoscopic colorectal surgery could be reduced with lidocaine patch at the wound site or with infusion of metamizole and tramadol and if the results meets epidural analgesia. We also compared the incidence of postoperative neuropathic pain among groups.\n",

      "Prospective, randomised trial with 4 parallel groups was conducted at the University medical centre (UMC) Ljubljana. ASA (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) Class 2-3 high risk surgical patients from the Clinical department of abdominal surgery were included in the study.

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "Studies have shown that Pilates exercises are one of the exercises that can improve breathing capacity, coordination, balance, flexibility, and muscular endurance. Pilates exercises improve walking and balance, reduce back pain and prevent further pain or injury. These are all common problems for people who have undergone lower extremity amputation. The aim of our study is to improve the pelvis-trunk coordination, gait symmetry, and balance on individuals who have undergone amputation and also to increase body awareness.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "The patients will be randomly assigned to two groups. Clinical Pilates (CP) and Classic Physiotherapy (CF). Two groups will be Transfemoral and Transtibial amputees, one CP, and the other CF. Groups will be treated for a period of 12 weeks. The assessment will be made before the treatment and after 12 weeks. Patients will practise exercises 3 times a week, one time in clinics with a physiotherapist and 2 times as home exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the clinical Pilates group, exercises that improve back extensor, trunk flexor, and pelvis stabilization will be applied along with breathing exercises. The classic group consists of straight leg raising, back extensors strengthening, abdominal strengthening exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gait spatiotemporal parameters, balance, fall risk and mobility, functional capacity, core muscle endurance, and strength, the pain will be evaluated. Quality of life, body image, and also prosthesis satisfaction will be evaluated.\n",

      "The tandem walk test (TWT) is a physical performance test used to assess balance and coordination. During the TWT, the individual is asked to walk a straight line, placing the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other foot. This creates a \"tandem\" or heel-to-toe gait. The individual is instructed to take as many steps as possible along the line without stepping off or losing balance. The TWT is typically performed over a distance of 3-5 meters, and the time it takes the individual to complete the test is recorded.\n",

      "to investigate the effects of an APA program which includes therapeutic patient education (TPE) on 3 primary outcomes: perceived pain, QoL, and PA. A complementary aim is to determine the effect of the program on psychosocial and motivational variables, and on physiological variables.\n",

      "a. Objectives and research hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "Endometriosis and its consequences Endometriosis is a chronic disease characterized by growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity which affects 200 million women (The investigators use the word \"women\" generically. However, this study takes into account gender identity. In other words, a person with endometriosis may identify as a man, as woman or no/other gender.) worldwide. In addition to infertility, one of the most common symptoms of endometriosis is pelvic chronic pain. Evidence has suggested that these symptoms result from a local inflammatory peritoneal reaction caused by ectopic endometrial implants that undergo cyclic bleeding. This disease generates significant health care costs (e.g., 9,5 billion in France) because there is no definite cure for it and its management involves pain related treatment and/or surgery. Research showed that these treatments are only relatively effective in reducing pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pain can cause psychological distress and interpersonal difficulties that are as difficult to live with as the pain itself. Compared to women who do not suffer from endometriosis, women with this disease develop a lower sense of femininity, altered body image, higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety. These factors affect their quality of life (QoL) and can have deleterious effects on the response to treatment. Interpersonal relationships are also impacted such as romantic, professional and social relationships, because the symptoms make it difficult to move and carry out daily activities. However, studies on the psychological and social consequences of endometriosis are scarce, few have investigated life-partners' view of the disease and its consequences, and all adopt cross-sectional designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of physical activity on endometriosis: a question for further investigation In their recent publication, INSERM (L'Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale) highlights the beneficial effects of regular physical activity (PA) and adapted physical activity (APA) on chronic diseases. Research suggested that (A)PA may have a beneficial effect on the physical symptoms and the psychological and social consequences of these diseases, thus may be also in endometriosis context. However, studies questioning the link between PA and endometriosis (and its symptoms) are rare, cross-sectional, and their results are inconsistent. The scarcity of studies can be explained by the fact that due to the painful symptoms caused by the disease; women do not practice much PA spontaneously and autonomously or even avoid practicing. In addition to this difficulty, widely recognized barriers to PA (i.e., lack of time, lack of adequate and nearby infrastructure, and low self-confidence and motivation for PA) can also contribute to the low level of PA. It is worth noticing that, in the specific context of endometriosis, the barriers and facilitators to the practice of PA are not clearly identified. Otherwise, due to their cross-sectional design, it was not possible for these studies to establish a causal link between PA and endometriosis. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to test the effects of (A)PA on the symptoms of endometriosis and its consequences.\n",
      "Summary of scientific barriers to be lifted\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on previous research and their limits, there are three major scientific barriers to be lifted regarding the investigation of the link between (A)PA and endometriosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a need to better understand the psychological and social factors associated to endometriosis. For instance, consequences of endometriosis on these factors and the impact of the disease in romantic relationships (i.e., on the patient and on her life partner2) need to be more documented. Some of these factors could be related to patient PA or could mediate or moderate the relation between endometriosis (and its symptoms) and PA.\n",
      "Although barriers of PA are well known, in the context of endometriosis the barriers and facilitators to the practice of PA are not clearly identified. Given the specificity of this disease which only affect women and its impact on body functioning and body perception, this topic deserves to be investigated.\n",
      "Otherwise, due to their scarcity and their cross-sectional design, it was not possible for previous studies to strongly establish a causal link between PA and, endometriosis and its symptoms. Conducting a RCT may help to overcome this limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Objectives and hypotheses The investigators' ambition for this original work is to fill these gaps in the existing literature and to allow a more comprehensive view of the phenomena at play in the relation between PA and endometriosis. For this purpose, The investigators will use a multimethodological design and a multidisciplinary approach in one of the first intervention study led with patients who suffer from endometriosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within two work packages (WP) the investigators will identify the perceived effects of the disease specifically those related to PA, and investigate the reasons why patients are or are not physically active using qualitative and quantitative methodologies (WP1). Otherwise, this first study will allow investigating and thus identifying the barriers and leverages to PA in the specific context of endometriosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "This information could be particularly interesting in the development of the WP2. Indeed, in WP2 which is an exploratory study, The investigators will investigate the effects of an APA program delivered by videoconferencing which include therapeutic patient education (TPE) on PA and sedentary behaviors (SED), on perceived pain, QoL, and on patients' physical, physiological (inflammatory status and oxidative stress) social and psychological health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary objectives of the WP2 were to investigate the effects of the CRESCENDO program on PA and SED but also on perceived pain and QoL. The investigators choose to also investigate pain and QoL as primary outcomes because their evolution are key elements in endometriosis setting. Thus, the primary outcomes were defined as the proportion of patients who\n",
      "\n",
      "achieve the internationally recommended level of PA international recommendations, i.e., at least 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous PA\n",
      "indicate a decrease in their perceived pain level (at least 1 point or 1 centimeter on visual analogue scale)\n",
      "indicate an increase in their QoL level (at least 20 points)\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators hypothesize that the CRESCENDO program could (H1) complement current treatments for endometriosis by increasing PA and reducing SED, reducing pain (due to the decrease of inflammatory status), increasing QoL, (H2) have beneficial effects on patients' physical, psychological and social health as well as physiological factors. Finally, a program combining APA and TPE will be more effective than one that offers these interventions separately (H3). It is worth noticing that, the questionnaire which will be propose in WP2 will be similar to those proposed in WP1. The investigators expect to find coherent results, that is, The investigators expect to explain part of the WP2 results based on WP1 results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the expected benefits for the patients benefiting from the program, the investigators hope that the results of this study will lead to the generalization of the integration of APA and TPE programs into endometriosis care protocols. These practices could be considered as a complement, or even an alternative, to treatments to reduce healthcare costs. The use of videoconferencing to deliver APA programs would remove barriers to PA related to the availability and proximity of sports facilities and scheduling constraints, as much as allow the continuity of the practice even if the health context imposes a lockdown (e.g., COVID-19), while allowing for a group practice that is adapted and emotionally reassuring. Finally, the inclusion of chronic diseases among the diseases for which patient can benefit of a medical prescription for sport (i.e., APA) and the launch of the national strategy against endometriosis lead by C. Zacharopoulou in Marsh 2021, confirmed in January 2022, emphasized the importance of these related topics: endometriosis and APA. The investigators hope the results of this study to be informative to select the type of care which is the most adapted and efficient to endometriosis patients, that is to shed light on the importance of proposing a comprehensive care which could have an impact on physical and psychosocial variables.\n",

      "The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of bone-anchored rapid maxillary expansion (RME) in the volume of the right maxillary sinus, left maxillary sinus and nasal and maxillary sinus airway complex, through bone anchored maxillary expansion devices (BAME); in addition, the influence of gender and age in the volume changes will be also analyzed. Material and method: 18 patients between undergone RME treatment with a jackscrew based on 4 miniscrews which will be placed in the palate on both sides of the midpalatal suture. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans will be taken before and after suture palatine expansion and datasets will be uploaded into therapeutic digital planning software to measure the volume (mm3) of the right maxillary sinus, left maxillary sinus (mm3) and nasal and maxillary sinus airway complex (mm3). The airway volumes will be isolated after selecting the anatomical area in the axial, coronal and sagittal space plane and ensuring the air density measurement by reference points placement inside the selected area. Statistical analysis between preoperative and postoperative measurements will be performed using the statistical analysis of the t-test.\n",

      "Lung Protective Ventilation (LPV) is considered the gold standard of care nowadays. Even though, all over the world reported adherence to this concept, among anesthesiologists, is only 15%. The investigators hypothesized that the introduction of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document will increase adherence to LPV among anesthesiologists. In this study, the investigators will record ventilating parameters during general anesthesia using Care Station Insights software. Then, the investigators will evaluate the recorded parameters and match them with LPV criteria. The adherence level to every parameter separately will be counted in percentage.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "In this study, the investigators will start by stating the current adherence level to the LPV concept during general anesthesia among anesthesiologists. The evaluation will be based on saved data in Care Station Insights software from General Electric. This software is running on anesthesia machines GE Aysis CS2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each parameter will be evaluated separately. The adherence level for each parameter will be interpreted as a percentage of cases that meet the LPV criteria in terms of the given parameter. The investigators will evaluate the 100 most recent cases, before the SOP introduction, to state the current adherence level.\n",
      "\n",
      "After stating the current adherence level to the LPV during general anesthesia, the investigators will introduce the Standard Operating Procedure document (SOP). SOP introduction will be supplemented with an educational program regarding LPV.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOP will include:\n",

      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Child sexual exploitation and abuse is a large-scale global issue that has been drastically rising since the advent of the internet that has brought about communication technologies enabling new ways to sexually abuse children. In addition, existing programs for individuals concerned about their sexual urges and behavior toward children are generally sparse across the European Union (EU) and most have not been evaluated using rigorous scientific designs. Furthermore, those seeking to participate in prevention programs are often met with many internal and external barriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, to reduce the barriers often faced by those seeking help for their sexual urges to engage in child sexual exploitation or abuse, Prevent It was developed. Prevent It is a free, anonymous, internet-delivered, and clinician-guided, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for adults who are concerned about their urges to engage in child sexual exploitation or abuse behaviors. It was developed based on many years of clinical experience from working with this patient group, as well as results from several previous research projects in the area of child sexual abuse. Pilot results from a randomized clinical trial that assigned 160 child sexual abuse material (CSAM) users recruited from darknet forums to the intervention or placebo condition found that Prevent It significantly reduced CSAM use, that the program was safe from a negative side effects perspective, and well appreciated by the participants. However, the evaluation also revealed that participant attrition was high, particularly in the intervention condition, with almost half of the participants dropping out after the first two modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevent It was updated to Prevent It 2.0 based on feedback from participants and clinicians in the pilot study. It now contains 9 modules - with the first module focused on motivational engagement - that are completed over 9 weeks, with a 4 week follow up. The content of the therapy provided is classic CBT. Prevent It 2.0 will be provided in English, Swedish, German, and Portuguese. The Swedish, German, and Portuguese language versions are being evaluated within the framework of this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a randomized controlled trial with waitlist control - a scientifically rigorous design - we will evaluate the effectiveness of the Swedish, German, and Portuguese versions of Prevent It 2.0. This is part of a larger project (Prevention to Reduce Incidence of Sexual Abuse by Reaching Individuals Concerned About Their Risk to Young People; PRIORITY) funded by the European (EU) Commission aimed at translating and culturally adapting Prevent It 2.0 into German, Portuguese, and Swedish. Effectiveness of the program will be evaluated based on the impact of Prevent It 2.0 on participants sexual urges toward children.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "The investigators will test a new rehabilitation protocol on patients with persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). The investigators hypothesize that patients with PPPD, in the absence of vestibular deficits, do not benefit from standard vestibular rehabilitation but instead need a rehabilitation that acts on visual and postural stability, through training of saccadic movements in dynamic contexts of cognitive-motor dual-task and rehabilitation of postural stability.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic functional vestibular disorder that manifests as a sensation of non-vertiginous dizziness and instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common triggers of PPPD are peripheral vestibular conditions such as vestibular neuritis (VN) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), although vestibular migraine, central vestibular disorders and non-vestibular conditions such as panic attacks, minor injuries traumatic brain injury and also orthostatic intolerance have been reported as precipitants of PPPD. PPPD persists after the triggering events have resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagnostic criteria for PPPD were established by the Barany Society. Once the negativity of the routine vestibular tests has been ascertained, the diagnosis is based on additional criteria such as the persistence of the symptom of dizziness for most of the time for at least 3 months, the worsening of the symptoms when standing, during active movement or passive, during exposure to moving visual stimulation or to visual stimuli with complex textures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, vestibular habituation) are only partially successful in PPPD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods. Experimental design. Single-blind randomized controlled trial. 40 individuals affected by PPPD will be recruited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups and evaluated before the rehabilitation training (T0), immediately after the end of the training (T1), 4 weeks after the end of the training (T2) and 8 weeks after the end of the training (T3). All patients will undergo 5 rehabilitation sessions supervised by a physiotherapist with experience in rehabilitation of balance disorders. The experimental group will carry out a interactive visuo-vestibular training (IVV) in order to facilitate postural visual stability and the control group will carry out a conventional vestibular rehabilitation training aimed at training the vestibular reflexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rehabilitation protocols (IVV and vestibular) will consist of 1 session of 40 minutes per week, for a total of 5 sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "IVV training consists of exercises that stimulate saccadic movements during motor activities on the treadmill and walking on the treadmill blindfolded with the support and supervision of the physiotherapist.\n",

      "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the act of venipuncture is more successful on the first attempt using near infrared light compared to a standard puncture on children or newborn whose venous access is considered difficult due to lack of visibility of the veins.\n",

      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "This trial aims to evaluate the act of venipuncture with or without the near-infrared light device for any children requiring a venipuncture for a blood sample in neonatal intensive care and neonatology, and in pediatric emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For any eligible patient, at least one parent will be approached by a member of the medical or paramedical team trained on the protocol to explain the study to him/her and to be able to include the child during the next venous blood sampling. In case the parent agrees on the child's participation, the investigator is in charge of obtaining an informed consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next venous blood sampling, the nurse responsible for the patient:\n",

      "Takes the next consecutively numbered randomization envelope from the room intended for this purpose. This envelope is opaque and contains the randomization group in which the child is assigned (near infrared light or standard technique)\n",
      "Takes a study observation book located in the room intended for this purpose.\n",
      "Once the nurse is ready to do the venipuncture and before having identified the vein to be punctured, he/she opens the envelope to find out whether or not near infrared light will be used for spotting the vein to be punctured while the person (caregiver or nurse) who will help him during the collection is present.\n",
      "Venous blood sampling according to the technique indicated by the randomization (near infrared light or standard technique) for the first attempt at venipuncture.\n",
      "If the first venipuncture attempt fails, the nurse can chose to carry out the 2nd or 3rd attempt with or without near infrared light. Only the first 3 attempts progress will be recorded in the observation book.\n",
      "When the venous blood drawing is over, whether it is successful or not, the assistant present during the sampling completes the observation book on the sampling part.\n",
      "The notebook and the envelope used are stored in the room intended for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid device-related bias, the AccuVein® AV 400 (CE 0086 marking) was chosen. This device uses near infrared light to detect superficial veins under the skin and then projects an image of these veins onto the skin surface, exactly above the veins. The device will be held between 10 and 20 cm perpendicular to the skin, because at this distance the projected image corresponds to the actual size of the veins located below the skin. It will be either attached to an articulated arm in order to free the operator's hands to perform the procedure, or held by an assistant above the venipuncture site. The assistant can reorient the device during the procedure. The light from the AccuVein® device should not be aimed at the child's eyes. In neonatal intensive care and neonatology, during any use, the newborn's eyes will be covered during the procedure's implementation.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "In France, the prevalence of undernutrition in hospitalized patients varies from 30 to 50%. Undernutrition is strongly associated with a decrease in the patient's functional abilities and an increase in morbidity and mortality and healthcare expenses. In 2019, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) published an international consensus report on diagnostic criteria for undernutrition. The diagnostic criteria are numerous, and include etiological criteria such as reduced food intake; an inflammatory setting; symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue; phenotypic criteria such as weight loss, body mass index (BMI), fat to lean mass ratio, fluid retention, and muscle function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muscle mass is described as a major diagnostic criterion, since it is on the one hand a direct indicator of protein catabolism related to undernutrition, but also a reflection of functional impairment in the patient, as it is directly associated with functional capacities, autonomy and prognosis. Ultrasound is a reproducible method of muscle assessment. It allows the evaluation of muscle thickness or cross-sectional area of a muscle, the reduction of which, a marker of atrophy, is strongly correlated to its loss of strength and to reference measurements. In addition, ultrasound can be used to assess muscle quality, particularly by evaluating the echogenicity of the muscle. The echogenicity increases when the muscle is altered, linked to the presence of fatty infiltrate and fibrous tissue. The use of ultrasound in the evaluation of the patient's nutritional status, as a tool for assessing muscle function, is developing in the ICU and is associated with an increase in the patient's comorbidities. Studies remain limited to a few patient populations, do not report clear cut-off values to define muscle pathological status, and require more precise definition of ultrasound measurement protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators hypothesize that muscle ultrasound is reliable and valid in the evaluation of muscle function during the screening of undernutrition in a population of patients hospitalized in diabetology-obesity, pneumology, oncology and gastro-nutrition, under 70 years old.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Rationale 1.1 Epidemiology and morbidity of undernutrition Undernutrition, whether related to disease, poverty, hunger, war or natural disasters, affects more than one billion people worldwide. In France, an empirical estimate suggests a prevalence of undernutrition among hospitalized patients of about 2 million or 30 to 50%. It should be noted that undernutrition is very common in and out of hospital. It is widely accepted that undernutrition can be caused by a deficit in nutrient intake or malabsorption. However, it is now known that the inflammatory state present during illness is associated with undernutrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 International consensus on the definition of undernutrition\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) published an international consensus report on diagnostic criteria for undernutrition. The diagnostic criteria are numerous, and include etiological criteria such as reduced food intake; an inflammatory context; symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue; phenotypic criteria such as weight loss, body mass index (BMI), fat to lean mass ratio, fluid retention, and muscle function. GLIM has chosen to select the most relevant criteria among the etiological and phenotypic criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "Etiological criteria: reduced food intake and inflammatory state of the patient;\n",
      "Phenotypic criteria: weight loss, BMI, and reduced muscle mass. The presence of at least one etiological criterion and one phenotypic criterion is mandatory to make the diagnosis of undernutrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muscle mass is described as a major diagnostic criterion, since it is on the one hand a direct indicator of protein catabolism related to undernutrition, but also a reflection of functional impairment in the patient, as it is directly associated with functional capacities, autonomy and prognosis. Different measurement tools are suggested, such as bioelectrical impedancemetry, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, leaving the choice of tool to the clinicians, depending on experience and local resources. Handgrip measurement is considered a complementary measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "GLIM recommends an assessment of the risk of undernutrition, using validated questionnaires such as the NRS (Nutritional Risk Screening) or the MNA-SF (Mini Nutritional Assessment- Short Form). The degree of severity of undernutrition is only assessed on the basis of phenotypic criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Roles of professionals in screening for undernutrition\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, and more particularly in the Forcilles hospital, dieticians play a major role in detecting undernutrition. They ensure a prospective watch on the patient's admission to the hospital, with the collection of indicators related to BMI and weight loss, in collaboration with the nurses and care assistants. They also carry out a dietary consultation to clarify the above criteria, to evaluate the reduction of intake and absorption, in collaboration with the physician, and the realization of body composition measurements, such as bio-electrical impedancemetry. The evolution of the definition of undernutrition, with an important place in the muscular and functional evaluation of the patient, implies new actors: the physiotherapist and the Adapted Physical Activity Teacher (APAT). Indeed, they have expertise in the evaluation of the patient's muscular function and functional capacities. As part of their diagnostic assessment, the physiotherapist is used to evaluating muscle function by dynamometry, as well as the patient's functional capacities by field tests or the use of scores. The EAPA also participates in the performance of field tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collaboration between dieticians, physiotherapists, EAPAs, nurses, care assistants and doctors thus makes it possible to meet the need to screen for undernutrition according to this new definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Assessment of muscle function\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical therapists and EAPAs use different tools to assess different aspects of muscle function, such as strength or walking speed in more functional tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isometric grip strength is strongly correlated with lower extremity muscle strength, and is a pejorative marker of mobility in weakness. It has been observed a linear relationship between grip strength and patient disability as measured by the Katz independence scale. In addition, grip strength has been shown to be a good predictor of the patient's clinical condition. The measurement of grip strength, using a dedicated dynamometer, also has the advantage of being simple and reproducible and has reference values adjusted for sex and BMI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gait speed is another indicator used to assess muscle function. It is associated with lower limb strength and is a predictor of disability and mobility limitation. Usual walking speed is most often measured over a distance of 4 or 6 m and has reference values adjusted for sex and height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dietitians also participate in the evaluation of muscle function by measuring body composition in terms of lean and fat mass. They perform bioelectrical impedancemetry, which allows estimation of body fat and lean mass volumes by measuring the resistance of biological tissues to a low-intensity, high-frequency sinusoidal electric current through electrodes. This measurement method is simple to use, inexpensive, reproducible and feasible in bedridden patients. It also correlates very well with MRI and reference values are obtained in various adult populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.5 Muscle ultrasound and undernutrition\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultrasound is a reproducible method of muscle assessmen. It allows the assessment of muscle thickness or cross-sectional area of a muscle, the reduction of which is a marker of atrophy and is strongly correlated with its loss of strength and reference measurements. In addition, ultrasound can be used to assess muscle quality, particularly by evaluating the echogenicity of the muscle. Echogenicity increases with muscle damage, related to the presence of fatty infiltrate and fibrous tissue. Complementary measurements such as pennation angle, fascicular length or fibrillations allow to complete the description of the muscle state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muscle ultrasonography is becoming increasingly used among the tools for assessing muscle function, especially in sarcopenia found in many pathological situations. Its use in the evaluation of the patient's nutritional status, as a tool for assessing muscle function, is developing in the ICU and is associated with an increase in the patient's comorbidities. Studies remain limited to a few patient populations, do not report clear cut-off values to define muscle pathological status, and require more precise definition of ultrasound measurement protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6 Research hypothesis\n",

      "The investigators hypothesize that muscle ultrasound is reliable and valid in the evaluation of muscle function during the screening of undernutrition in a population of hospitalized patients in diabetology-obesity, pneumology, oncology and gastro-nutrition, under 70 years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective 2.1 Main objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of muscle ultrasound in the context of screening for undernutrition in patients hospitalized in short-stay and follow-up care and rehabilitation of diabetology-obesity, pneumology, oncology and gastro-nutrition.\n",

      "3. Type of study: This is a prospective, monocentric, interventional cohort study. The research will be conducted in accordance with the protocol. The duration of the recruitment will be 20 months with a follow-up of the patients during their entire hospitalization in the care unit, i.e. approximately 30 days (average length of stay), i.e. a total duration of the study estimated at 21 months.

All of this care will not be modified within the framework of this protocol. Physiotherapists and dieticians provide their diagnostic assessment and rehabilitation on medical prescription. The EAPAs participate in the functional evaluation of the patient and carry out physical activities adapted to the patient, also on medical prescription.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the screening for undernutrition in our establishment, the dieticians ensure a prospective and systematic collection of the patient's weight and its evolution over the last few months, of his BMI and an evaluation of the food intake, within 48 hours of the patient's admission to the service. The estimation of the patient's intake is done in collaboration with the nursing assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Nutritional assessment At the patient's admission, a dietetic evaluation is performed by the dietician following the recommendations issued by the French Association of Dieticians-Nutritionists and the HAS. The dietitian collects all the data needed to detect malnutrition, such as weight, height, BMI, albumin level, and grip strength and walking speed (performed by the caregiver and the physiotherapist or the EAPA). The dietician also looks for possible obstacles to feeding such as dental condition, swallowing problems or digestive discomfort The doctor looks for different pathologies impacting digestive absorption such as shortened or shortened stool syndromes, gastrectomies, pancreatic insufficiency etc. He also looks for factors of aggression such as cancers, chronic progressive diseases, infections etc.\n",

      "4.2.1 Anthropometric measurements When the patient is admitted, the ward's nurses and orderlies measure the patient's weight and height. When the patient can maintain the erect position, a conventional scale and a measuring rod are used for the measurements. If the patient cannot maintain this position, a weighing chair and a laser meter are used.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to evaluate the weight loss before hospitalization, the previous weight is sought in a hospitalization report or another recent medical document. A contact with the attending physician is also made in order to obtain information concerning the patient's weight follow-up. When this information is not available, the previous weight given by the patient is collected.\n",

Expected results in terms of scientific and professional advances The results of this study will make it possible to verify whether ultrasound is a reliable and valid tool in the evaluation of peripheral muscle function in the context of screening for undernutrition. On the other hand, they will allow us to propose threshold values for the alteration of muscle function and to provide information on the ultrasound characteristics of the muscle in the undernourished patient and their association with the prognosis of the patient. The different tools could lead to a different estimation of the reduction of muscle mass and therefore a different prevalence of undernutrition. The results of our study will help to evaluate this and to guide professionals in the choice of tools to assess muscle function.\n",

      "8 Expected benefits and risks for patients 8.1 Minimal risks and constraints added by the research\n",
      "\n",
      "All medical and paramedical examinations and management are usually performed except for the MNA-SF questionnaire, muscle ultrasound and bioelectrical impedancemetry, which will be performed systematically in the patients included. The MNA-SF questionnaire is very quick (less than 5 minutes) and therefore causes very little inconvenience to the patient apart from an additional visit by a caregiver. Bioelectrical impedancemetry is a tool for assessing body composition using electrodes applied to the skin surface. The examination lasts an average of 15 minutes and is non-invasive and painless. The minimal constraint is related to the placement of the electrode and the duration of the examination. The ultrasound is also non-invasive and painless. The 3 ultrasounds performed will last about 30m. The minimal constraint is related to the installation of the ultrasound probe and the duration of the examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2 Expected benefits for the patient\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultrasound is a relatively simple and inexpensive tool compared to other methods of measuring body composition (DEXA or MRI) and provides additional information on muscle quantity and quality compared to the usual tools for measuring muscle function (Handgrip, functional tests). The results of this study will make it possible to propose to the patient a reliable and valid evaluation tool, more easily available and less restrictive in the evaluation of the muscular quality during undernutrition. This could lead to a wider and more precise evaluation of this muscular impairment in order to propose more adapted therapeutic solutions (exercise training, weight training, nutrition).\n",

      "Spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT or GRID) addresses some limitations of traditional stereotactic body radiation therapy by relying on beam collimation to create high-dose \"peaks\" and intervening low-dose \"valleys\" throughout the target volume. Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens provide limited durability of response, and there are challenges with delivery to large tumors or in previously irradiated fields. In this study, Proton GRID radiotherapy will be used to deliver three-fraction palliative radiotherapy to patients with tumors needing palliative radiation. The safety and efficacy of this approach will be assessed. It is hypothesized that GRID is highly effective, immunogenic, and associated with low rates of toxicity.\n",

The results of the questions are used to calculate two summary scores: a Global Physical Health Score and a Global Mental Health score. These scores are then standardized to the general population, using the \"T-Score\". The average \"T-Score\" for the United States population is 50 points, with a standard deviation of 10 points. Higher scores are indicative of a healthier patient.\n",

      "The aim EXACT@Home is to create an evidence-based health program using e.g. questionnaires, a digital health platform and multiple digital devices to further improve the assessment of patients diagnosed with severe asthma. By better charting treatable traits (e.g. poor adherence, physical inactivity, dysfunctional breathing), we expect to improve the indication for the use of biologics. One the devices that will be used is also a medicinal product: a digital inhaler, which monitors adherence and inhaler technique through its connected application and aims to improve adherence and inhaler technique with reminders and notifications. Next to this an activity tracker, hand-held spirometer and FeNO measuring device will be used. The information of the devices will be collected in a Personal Digital Healthcare Environment (PDHE). Patients diagnosed with severe asthma according to the regional asthma Multi-Disciplinary Team Meeting (MDTM) eligible for a treatment with biologics will be included. Half of the patients will immediately receive a biologic. The other half will first undergo the systematic assessment including home monitoring (=EXACT@home) and afterwards a treatment will be chosen based on this evaluation: optimization of treatable traits when present and/or biologics. The chosen treatment of both, the intervention and control group, will be evaluated during 11-12 months.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Rationale:\n",
      "\n",
      "Asthma is a common multifactorial disease with chronic inflammation of the lower airways, which is in most cases adequately treated by inhalation medication. 17% of asthma patients have difficult-to-treat asthma, which is uncontrolled despite of an optimal treatment with medication due to the presence of 'treatable traits'. Examples of treatable traits are poor adherence to ICS/LABA therapy and inhaler technique, dysfunctional breathing, physical inactivity and behavior. Severe and refractory asthma is a subtype of difficult-to-treat asthma and only occurs if the asthma is uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with medication and addressing of treatable traits, which occurs in only 3.7% of all asthma patients. This group of patients is responsible for a high burden of overall disease, as well as large healthcare costs.Treatment options with biologics have fundamentally changed the care for patients with severe asthma by giving a relevant improvement in asthma control, the number of asthma exacerbations and quality of life. On the other hand, these drugs are also very expensive and must be given for the correct indication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Centre of Excellence for severe Asthma, Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam organizes a weekly Multi-Disciplinary Team Meeting (MDTM) for hospitals in the South-West of the Netherlands to discuss their patients with problematic asthma and to start a treatment with biologics approved for severe asthma (in this document further called biologics). Despite maximal efforts of all stakeholders, the complete overview of a patient and the treatable traits is often hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of severe asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of the EXACT@Home (Expertise Asthma COPD program with digital support) study is to further improve the assessment of treatable traits using ehealth before considering treatment with biologics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary objective: To investigate if the EXACT@home program results in a reduced percentage of patients treated with biologics by means of systematically targeting treatable traits measured after 6 months of follow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary objectives: To determine whether the use of EXACT@home results in a reduced percentage of patients treated with biologicals after 11-12 months. Next to this it will be investigated if EXACT@home has an influence on quality of life, asthma control, dyspnea perception, lung function, exacerbation frequency, prednisolone use, direct healthcare consumption, self-management skills, patient satisfaction, adherence to ICS/LABA therapy and inhaler technique, physical activity, sleep and vital parameters. Next to this, breath pattern analysis will be performed with the electronic nose (eNose). Moreover, the safety of the Digital inhaler (BF-Digihaler-DS from Teva) and eNose (Spironose from Breathomix) and the course of the treatment in each patient will also be investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Study design:\n",
      "\n",
      "Open-label, randomized controlled trial with a superiority design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Study population:\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients aged ≥ 18 years, in which the diagnosis severe and refractory asthma and eligibility for treatment with biologics was determined at the regional asthma MDTM will be asked to participate in this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intervention (if applicable):\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients will be randomized in 2 groups (intervention - and control group). The intervention group participates in a holistic assessment called EXACT@home consisting of a period of 6 weeks addressing diagnosis, asthma phenotype and treatable traits using e.g. questionnaires and digital devices measuring airway obstruction, eosinophilic airway inflammation, adherence to ICS/LABA therapy, inhalation technique, movement, vital parameters and sleep. The information of the devices and all other information concerning the patient will be stored in an 'Personal Digital Healthcare Environment (PDHE)'. Afterwards the collected data will be evaluated. Based on this evaluation and the degree of asthma control the type of treatment will be determined: optimization of 'treatable traits' or start of treatment with biologics. The control group will immediately start the treatment with biologics. The chosen treatment of both, the intervention and control group, will be evaluated during 11-12 months.\n",

      "Main study parameters/endpoints:\n",
      "\n",
      "Study parameter primary outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "Difference between the intervention and control group in the percentage of patients treated with biologicals after 6 months of follow up.\n",

      "Study parameters secondary outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "The percentage of patients treated with biologicals after 11-12 months of follow up, quality of life, asthma control, dyspnea perception, lung function, exacerbation frequency, prednisolone use, direct healthcare consumption, self-management skills, patient satisfaction, adherence to ICS/LABA therapy, inhaler technique, physical activity, slap, vital parameters, breath pattern analysis with the eNose, safety of the digital inhaler and eNose and the course of the treatment in each patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:\n",
      "\n",
      "The possible burden of the intervention group is temporarily postponing an effective treatment with biologics in favour of in depth extensive assessment in patients with a severe disease for a short period of at least 6 weeks. On the other hand, the patient could benefit from the EXACT@home assessment possibly leading to a personalized treatment, in which a treatment with biologics might not be necessary anymore. Next to this, another possible minor burden is 1 extra visit in addition to standard care.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression on cancer cells. TNBCs accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers (BC).1 It is characterized by a worse prognosis, increased risk of metastasis to vital organs and a relative lack of therapeutic target if compared to other BC subtypes.2 Therefore, the identification of new molecular targets and therapeutic strategies is a critical need in both early and metastatic setting. TNBC appears to be more immunogenic compared to other BC6. Immunotherapy has recently changed the landscape of therapeutic options in TNBC. Recent clinical trials have shown a significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with a combination of chemotherapy and anti PD-1 agents.11-12-13-14-15 In particular, results from IMPASSION 130 trial showed a significant benefit in both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+) patients treated with a combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel.20 However, about 70% of PD-L1+ patients has experienced a disease progression after one year and about 50% was alive at 2 year. Moreover, no difference in survival endpoint has been seen in PD-L1 negative (PD-L1-) population, with an increase of toxicity and costs related to the addition of a checkpoint-inhibitor. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers in addition to PD-L1 and the combination of several biomarkers in a profile with higher predictive capacity is considered an area of urgent clinical need. Some immune-related features that can be identified in tumor microenvironment have been demonstrated to be independent prognostic and predictive factors: TILs, PD-L1, CD73.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs) control the clinical progression of various types of cancer7. Breast cancer with higher levels of infiltrating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells have been associated with better patient survival8. Moreover, high levels of stromal CD8+ TILs (sTILs) correlate with higher probability of pCR9. Not only quantitative, but also qualitative analysis of TILs is a promising research area. Some studies suggest that different subtypes of TILs may have an opposite role in tumor microenvironment allowing the induction of both immune activating (es. CD8+) or immune suppressive (es FOXP3+) environment8-9-10.\n",
      "The interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) represents one of the principal mechanisms of immune escape and a therapeutic target for several malignancies13-14. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction attenuates lymphocyte activation and promotes T-regulatory cell development and function, allowing to terminate the immune response15. In breast cancer the prognostic role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis is still uncertain with limited and contrasting data. PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) on immune cells (IC) is the clinical most used threshold, according to the results of IMPASSION 130 trial.18-24\n",
      "Recently, CD73 has been identified as a possible further molecular immunosuppressive target in triple negative breast cancer28. CD73 is expressed on the surface of tumoral cells, stromal cells and immunological cells. By increasing extracellular levels of adenosine monophosphate , CD73 suppresses immune responses. CD73 has been found to be overexpressed in several types of human cancers, and it has been associated with a poor prognosis29-30-31. Particularly Loi et al demonstrated that high CD73 expression is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC and to a low rate of pathological complete response32.\n",
      "\n",
      "We defined a tissue immune profile positive (TIP+) as the simultaneous presence of TILs≥50%, CD73≤40% and PD-L1≥1%. Any other combination was defined as TIP negative (TIP-) In conclusion, we will evaluate the association between TIP and clinical outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS).\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "This clinical trial develops and tests how well a clinical decision support (CDS) tool works to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of children between the age of 9-17 (adolescents) in pharmacies. HPV vaccination rate in eligible adolescents remains low even though over 90% of the cancers in adults caused by HPV can be prevented by the HPV vaccine. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee recommends HPV vaccinations to be given in pharmacies to increase access to vaccines, but pharmacy processes and lack of awareness of the service among parents impact the use of local pharmacies for HPV vaccinations. Using a focus group may be an effective method to develop a CDS tool and create a process that may be more convenient for parents to get their adolescent's vaccine at their local pharmacy. A CDS tool may make it easier to obtain HPV vaccines, and as a result increase the adolescent HPV vaccination rate and reduce the incidence of cancer caused by HPV.\n",

In pediatric surgery, many mobile health applications have been developed to support pain management, symptom monitoring, medication adherence, support care processes, postoperative follow-up and self-management processes. In mobile health applications, no mobile application has been found for the use of parents of children with gastrostomy. In Turkey, there is no known nursing study for the use of parents of children with gastrostomy. The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application for the care of children with gastrostomy and to determine the effect of the application on gastrostomy complications, care burden of parents, self-efficacy and anxiety level.\n",

      "This research was planned in two stages as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first stage, it was aimed to develop a mobile application supported education programme (G-MUEP) for the care of children with gastrostomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second stage, it was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of G-MUEP.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this purpose, the hypotheses of the research are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Parents using G-MUEP are more effective than the parents in the control group; Hypothesis 1 (H1): care burden is less. Hypothesis 2 (H1): their self-efficacy is higher. Hypothesis 3 (H1): anxiety levels are lower. Compared to the children in the control group, the children of the parents using G-MUEP; Hypothesis 1 (H1): gastrostomy-related complication findings are less.\n",

      "Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale was developed by Zarit, Reever and Bach Peterson in 1980. It is used to assess the distress experienced by caregivers of individuals in need of care. The scale is a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5 as 'never', 'rarely', 'sometimes', 'often' or 'almost always'. Özlü, Yıldız & Aker (2009), who adapted the scale into Turkish, found the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale to be 0.83 (Özlü, Yıldız, & Aker, 2009). A minimum score of zero and a maximum score of 76 can be obtained from the scale. The items in the scale are generally related to the social and emotional domain, and a high scale score indicates that the distress experienced is high.\n",

      "The General Self-Efficacy Scale, developed by Schwarzer and Jarusalem in 1995 and validated by Aypay (2010) in Turkish, consists of 10 items in total. The scale, whose response category consists of a 4-point scale, is scored as \"Completely wrong = 1 point\", \"Somewhat correct = 2 points\", \"Moderately correct = 3 points\", and \"Completely correct = 4 points\". There are no reverse items and no cut-off points in the scale. The minimum score is 10 and the maximum score is 40. As the scale score increases, perceived self-efficacy increases. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient calculated in the Turkish validity-reliability study was found to be 0.83.\n",

The State/Trait Anxiety Scale includes 40 statements that individuals can use to express their feelings. Depending on how the individual feels and the severity of his/her emotions, it is possible to rate them as \"Not at all\" (1), \"A little\" (2), \"Quite a bit\" (3), \"Completely\" (4) should mark one of the options.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "Transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block is an effective method to manage postoperative pain in patients with midline abdominal wall incisions. It is used frequently in many lower abdominal surgeries however its use after caesarean section is still new, and fewer studies are available. We conducted this study to see the analgesic effect of TAP block after caesarean section.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "The study is being conducted, at Combined Military Hospital Sargodha, Pakistan, to compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP block in providing post-caesarean analgesia with the control group, in terms of mean postoperative use of opioids after caesarean delivery. Sixty patients have been randomly selected using non-probability, consecutive sampling, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study design is a randomized controlled trial with thirty patients in each group undergoing elective caesareans. All patients will be given spinal anaesthesia with 1.5ml of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine for a caesarean section. Patients in Group A will receive bilateral TAP block with 20ml of 0.25% bupivacaine while 20 ml of saline will be injected in patients of Group B on both sides of midline after caesarean section, in addition to intravenous ketorolac 8hrly. The intensity of pain, total opioid consumption, presence of vomiting, and sedation will be noted until 24 hours after the surgery.\n",

      "Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of De-escalation to lower dose Ticagrelor (60 mg BID) plus Aspirin (75 mg OD) versus continuation of standard dose Ticagrelor (90 mg BID) plus Aspirin (75 mg OD), 1 month after primary PCI for STEMI, in diabetic patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary objectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "To compare tolerability and discontinuation of Ticagrelor in both doses. To compare the 1ry safety & efficacy endpoints in subgroups with different thrombotic/ischemic risk\n",

      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "[15:42, 18/02/2023] M Taha: Ticagrelor at a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice a day (bid) was shown to provide greater and more consistent platelet P2Y12 inhibition than clopidogrel in patients with stable coronary artery disease (PA Gurbal, KP Bliden et al 2009) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (RF Storey, S Husted et al 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "The PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial demonstrated the superior efficacy of ticagrelor, given at a maintenance dose of 90 mg bid, compared with clopidogrel for up to 1 year in patients with ACS (L Wallentin, RC Becker et al 2009) [15:42, 18/02/2023] M Taha: Consequently, this regimen of ticagrelor is recommended in international guidelines as first-line therapy for up to 1 year following either non-ST-segment elevation ACS (P Damman, AW van't Hof et al 2017) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction managed with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PT O'gara, FG Kushner et al 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, ticagrelor maintenance doses of 60 mg b.i.d and 90 mg b.i.d were clinically equally effective in stable patients more than 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with a better tolerability of treatment observed with the lower dose (Bonaca MP, Bhatt DL et al 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "[15:42, 18/02/2023] M Taha: n a pharmacokinetic & pharmacodynamic substudy of the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, ticagrelor 60 mg bid achieved high levels of peak and trough platelet inhibition in nearly all patients, similar to that with 90 mg bid, helping to explain the efficacy of the lower ticagrelor dose in the trial.1 Most recently, in a pharmacodynamic randomized controlled study (ELECTRA), lowering ticagrelor maintenance dose to 60 mg b.i.d, on day 30 following acute MI, was shown to confer an adequate antiplatelet effect that is comparable to the standard maintenance dose of 90 mg b.i.d.2\n",

The goal of this information collection is to deepen the field's understanding of child care and early education licensing systems, which play a critical role in supporting positive outcomes for providers, families, and children.

      "This study aims to advance understanding of the landscape of child care and early education licensing systems. State/territory child care and early education licensing agencies establish and monitor regulations that child care programs serving young children must meet to operate legally. These regulations and monitoring practices play a large role in the operations of child care programs but have received relatively little research attention. The field has limited information about features of state/territory licensing units and limited information about child care and early education providers' experiences and perceptions of licensing (i.e., there are a few findings from individual states but no national survey). Ultimately, TRLECE: Licensed Child Care Providers findings can inform changes to licensing policies and practices in the child care and early education field, guidance and technical assistance to state leaders, and future research.\n",

      "The investigators will gather information for this descriptive study through a survey of licensed child care provider. This survey is designed to collect information about licensed child care and early education providers' experiences with child care licensing, including regulations and inspections; perceptions of the burden, value, and fairness of the licensing system; and perceived strengths of and challenges with the licensing system. We intend to invite a stratified random sample of directors of center-based programs and family child care providers from all 50 states and the DC to participate and will aim to have 1,000 participants from each group.\n",

      "Child Trends, funded by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE), Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will collect descriptive information for The Role of Licensing in Early Care and Education (TRLECE): Licensing Administrators project. The goal of this information collection is to deepen the field's understanding of child care and early education licensing systems, which play a critical role in supporting positive outcomes for providers, families, and children. The investigators will conduct one round of survey data collection with all state and territory child care and early education licensing administrators.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "This study aims to advance understanding of the landscape of child care and early education licensing systems. State/territory child care and early education licensing agencies establish and monitor regulations that child care programs serving young children must meet to operate legally. These regulations and monitoring practices play a large role in the operations of child care programs but have received relatively little research attention. The field has limited information about features of state/territory licensing units and the characteristics and perceptions of licensing administrators. TRLECE: Licensing Administrators findings can inform licensing policies and practices in the child care and early education field, guidance and technical assistance to state leaders, and future research.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this descriptive study, the investigators will conduct a survey of child care licensing administrators. This survey is designed to collect information about licensing administrator demographics, licensing agency structure and staff supports, ideas about the factors that influence decision-making, perceptions of strengths and challenges of the licensing system, and ideas to improve the licensing system. We will invite the licensing administrator from each state and territory (n = 56) to participate.\n",

      "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles, naturally released from the cells and mediators of intercellular cross-talk. In breast cancer (BC), EVs seem to be involved in the tumor microenvironment's shaping, in cancer cells invasion and in the set-up of metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical studies have provided initial evidence that EVs may have a prognostic and predictive value in breast cancer. Considering their presence in body fluids and their minimally invasive assessment through blood sampling, EVs could be liquid biopsy-derived biomarkers. Their quantification could be a complex challenge, requiring complicated and time-consuming pre-analytical procedures of EVs isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new method for the detection of tumor-derived-EVs associated proteins is based on the use of Single Molecule Array (SiMoA), a digital ELISA technology able to detect and quantify extremely low concentrations of target proteins or particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of this study is to evaluate how this new technology can allow the quantification EVs plasma levels in patients affected by BC, providing useful diagnostic and prognostic information about the efficacy of the neoadjuvant treatment.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "This is a prospective, observational, monocentric and no profit study. The study involves the analysis of plasma from patients with breast cancer to quantify and characterize tumor-derived EVs at specific disease stages, and to evaluate the efficacy of the neoadjuvant treatment.\n",

      "BC patients will be consequently included, at any TNM stage, undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy referring to an EUSOMA-accredited Breast Unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients will be divided into two groups, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Population 1: female patients diagnosed with breast cancer, at any TNM stage, who are candidate to neoadjuvant treatment.\n",
      "Population 2: a control group of sex and age matched healthy volunteers, not affected by breast cancer (with negative mammography, breast ultrasound or breast examination within 12 months of the study enrolment).\n",
      "\n",
      "For each BC patient, 4 blood samples will be collected at established time-points and plasma will be isolated. Blood samples will be collected as follows: the first sample (T0) before the first chemotherapy infusion; the second sample (T1) before the second chemotherapy infusion (Day 21); the third sample (T2) after the last chemotherapy infusion and before the surgical treatment (between 21 and 42 days after the last chemotherapy infusion); fourth and last sample 1 month after surgery (T3).\n",

      "This project will pilot the expansion of the existing Taussig Outreach Program's community outreach and patient navigation model to study the multiple myeloma (MM) screening program. This involves analyzing community reception, screening program methods, reasons patients decided to participate, reasons patients declined participation, and participant views and attitudes. This study also aims to gauge the current and general understanding of MM. This study seeks to recruit participants in the pilot screening program to promote early detection. Participants who have abnormal results will receive patient navigation for further diagnostics and testing.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematologic cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. Multiple Myeloma is always preceded by a pre-malignant condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma. Despite multiple therapeutic advances, there remains no cure for multiple myeloma. The disease is treated and monitored throughout a person's lifetime. This is why screening for early detection of this disease is important; however, MGUS and smoldering multiple myeloma are only diagnosed when they are found incidentally on labs during tests for unrelated symptoms. There are no current universal screening guidelines for MM. Among those who may benefit from MM screenings include African American/Black individuals, as it is twice as common in this population compared to Caucasian/White individuals. This study aims to develop a screening program specifically targeting underserved African American/Black individuals. This project will expand the existing Taussig Community Outreach screening program to include screening for multiple myeloma.\n",

      "\n",
      "It may be impossible to perform loco-regional anesthesia in various contexts: patient refusal, pre-existing neurological impairment, infection at the injection site, coagulopathies, inability to cooperate, total language barrier, allergy to anesthetics, unavailability of equipment (ultrasound, etc.) or equipped room, lack of experience of nursing staff in performing the block and in the postoperative management of the patient.\n",

      "Intraoperative administration of methadone in these settings may be superior to sufentanil for pain control during the 24 hours post orthopedic surgery, and the pain control provided by methadone does not appear to imply a higher likelihood of adverse events related to opioids.\n",

      "Diet and lifestyle changes are the recommended first line treatments for symptom relief in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Currently the only diet that is widely recommended and for which there is good evidence of efficacy in IBS is one low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (low-FODMAP). While effective, the Low-FODMAP diet is burdensome and costly to patients and in clinical practice adherence to FODMAP restriction is less than optimal. Further, those who respond to a FODMAP restriction often are reluctant to reintroduce more FODMAPs into their diet, which may deprive them of foods, particularly fruits and vegetables with important health benefits. Therefore, there is a need for other dietary interventions for IBS that are less burdensome to patients. We propose a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of two dietary interventions.\n",

      "The participants consisted of 1332 caregivers of patients diagnosed with cancer, who applied to Atatürk University Health Research and Application Center, Outpatient Chemotherapy Unit between December 2022 and March 2023. In the power analysis, the sample of the research; According to Cohen, a total of 108 people, 54 of whom were in the experimental group and 54 in the control group, with a medium effect size of 0.5%, an error margin of 0.05% and a confidence interval of 0.95%, were 95% representative of the universe. Against the possibility of data loss, 20% backup sample was included in this number and the study was planned with a total of 124 people, 62 in the experimental group and 62 in the control group. 20 participants were excluded on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 104 participants formed the sample\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Pretest measurements (T1) were made to the individuals in the experimental and control groups. 8-week mindfulness-based interventions were administered online to caregivers of cancer patients (Table 1). Before starting the MDI program in the experimental group, visual and written materials about the sessions prepared by the researchers were distributed. The program was implemented 4 days a week, 1 session a day, and each session was implemented in groups of 10-15 people for 60-90 minutes. After the 8-week MDI Program of the experimental group was completed, the data collection forms were re-applied to the individuals in the experimental and control groups, and posttest-1 measurements (T2) were made. 4 weeks after the posttest-1 measurements, the posttest-2 measurements (T3) of the individuals in the experimental and control groups were performed.\n",

Randomization was provided in the sample included in the study, and it was divided into experimental and control groups. At the beginning of the study, the Infertility Stress Scale was applied to women in both groups to determine their stress levels. Afterwards, 8 sessions of laughter yoga were applied to the experimental group for 4 weeks. No application was made to the control group. After 4 weeks, the Infertility Stress Scale was administered to the women in both groups to re-determine their stress levels.\n",

      "This research is a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of Laughter yoga on the stress levels of infertility women. At the beginning of the study, necessary ethics committee permission and institutional permissions were obtained. Both of the researchers have a certificate of leadership in laughter yoga. As a result of the power analysis, it was determined that 80 women should be included in the study. Considering that there may be losses, it was decided to include 90 women in the study. By providing randomization, 90 women who met the sampling criteria and volunteered to participate in the study were divided into two groups as 45 experimental and 45 control. At the beginning of the study, the Infertility stress scale was applied to women in both groups to determine their stress levels. Afterwards, 8 sessions of laughter yoga were applied to the experimental group for 4 weeks, two sessions a week. No application was made to the control group. After 4 weeks, the Infertility stress scale was administered to the women in both groups to re-determine their stress levels.\n",

      "The world's elderly population is increasing. It is possible to prepare for the old age period by starting to develop the level of Health Literacy (HL) in the 45-64 age group. In this context, this study is planned to be conducted as a randomized controlled study with an active control group in order to compare the effect of European Health Literacy-based education and e-Pulse education (HELP) on the level of health literacy in adults aged 45-64 with insufficient-limited health literacy. The study was planned to include a total of 140 participants from the intervention group (HELP) (n:70) and the active control group (e-Pulse) (n:70). Interactive group training consisting of six modules and 90 minutes each will be given to the HELP group. Individual e-Pulse instruction will be given to the active control group. European Health Literacy Scale scores will be considered as the primary outcome of the research. Scores from the eHealth Literacy Scale will be considered as the secondary outcome of the research.\n",

There is a 50% chance that instead of 'Ashwagandha capsule' you will receive 'Placebo capsule'. This placebo capsule will be identical in size, shape, and color to the 'Ashwagandha capsule'. The placebo capsule is harmless. It has the ingredient of starch powder made from corn, wheat, or potato. You will have to record the use of the assigned product on a daily diary for 8 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be monitored throughout the study. The study consists of two 60-minute onsite visits for visit 1 and visit 3, and one 40-minute remote visit via the phone for visit 2. After the initial visit 1 at the clinic (screening, baseline/randomization) (Day 1), you will be monitored and assessed remotely at visit 2 (week 4) over the phone. Then, you will have to visit the clinic for assessments at visit 3 (week 8). During visit 1 and visit 3, blood will be collected from you, physical examinations, and general examinations will be performed. During physical examinations, a medically trained personnel will measure your vital signs including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, respiratory rate, and body mass index. During general examination, a systemic review of different body systems will be performed to see if there are any significant abnormalities or findings.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "The purpose of this study is to understand how ketogenic food products affect oxygen toxicity in undersea divers. Oxygen toxicity affecting the central nervous system, mainly the brain, is a result of breathing higher than normal oxygen levels at elevated pressures as can be seen in SCUBA diving or inside a hyperbaric (pressure) chamber. This is a condition that may cause a wide variety of symptoms such as: vision disturbances, ear-ringing, nausea, twitching, irritability, dizziness, and potentially loss of consciousness or seizure. Because nutritional ketosis has been used to reduce or eliminate seizures in humans, it may be beneficial to reduce oxygen toxicity as well. The investigators hope this study will provide a help to develop practical and useful methods for improving the safety of undersea Navy divers, warfighters and submariners.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity continues to be a risk for military divers and constrains their operations. Manifestations of this condition range from nausea, twitching, and tinnitus to seizures and unresponsiveness, and the latter may lead to death by drowning. The NAVY has a need for better methods to prevent or delay the onset of CNS oxygen toxicity (CNSOT) and to safely expand the scope of diving operations. It is the broad objective of this study to generate information that will enhance warfighter safety and performance in relevant NAVY operations by reducing the risk of CNS oxygen toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is known that nutritional ketosis through a diet with a high fat-to-carbohydrate ratio (ketogenic diet) can reduce the frequency and severity of epileptic seizures in humans, and a recent animal study has shown that dietary ketosis also delays the onset of CNSOT. In recent years, ketone ester food products ketone esters have been made commercially available which may elevate circulating ketone levels. The investigators aim to investigate whether ketosis from commercially available ketogenic food products prior to a dive will delay the onset of CNSOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first aim of this study will be to determine the effect of ketone food product ingestion on serum ketone levels, and document any relevant side effects. Post-ingestion ketone levels will be trended for 3 different ketone food product regimens in 15 total subjects. Data will be used to select the optimal ketone food product strategy to investigate in the second aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second aim will be to evaluate the primary hypothesis, that pre-dive ketone food products will prolong latency to CNSOT. To assess this, 20 subjects will be studied in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover methodology. After consuming either the ketone food product or placebo, each subject will complete an immersed, head out hyperbaric oxygen exposure while exercising on an underwater cycle ergometer at 2.06 ATA (35 fsw) until oxygen toxicity symptoms develop or the maximum time limit of 120 minutes is reached. The experiment will be repeated on a different day by each subject after consuming the opposite (ketone food products or placebo). Primary outcome will be time to manifestation of CNSOT. Physiologic monitoring throughout the study will provide secondary endpoints such as cognitive performance, sympathetic nervous system stimulation via electrodermal activity, electroencephalography, cardiorespiratory measures and end-tidal CO2/O2/N2; all adding to our understanding of CNSOT physiology which may guide future mitigation and monitoring strategies.\n",

      "translation of the mBI into Italian, by using the froward-backward translation approach, to produce a pre-final mBI-Italian\n",
      "pre-pilot testing of the pre-final mBI-Italian in a sample of ten health professionals (physicians and physiotherapists), ten subjects who had a stroke, and 10 caregivers, i.e. subjects who take care of a person who had a stroke. All participants will be asked to judge the clarity of each item of the scale, including scoring instructions\n",
      "evaluation of the metric properties (internal consistency, inter- and intra-rater reliability, validity and responsiveness) of the final mBI-Italian in a sample of subjects admitted to the Don Gnocchi Foundation in Florence for rehabilitation after stroke\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "The modified Barthel Index (mBI) (Shah et al (1989) is a worldwide adopted scale which investigates independence in the basic activities of daily living. It comprises ten items as the original version (personal hygiene, bathing, feeding, toilet, stairs, dressing, bowels, bladder, transfers, ambulation/wheelchair management), with a modification to the scoring to enhance its responsiveness. The mBI has been cross-culturally adapted in several countries and languages, However, despite unofficial versions circulating in clinical settings, there is currently no validated Italian version of the scale. This study aims to develop this version and to evaluate its metric properties in a sample of subjects who had a stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pre-final mBI-Italian will be produced following established international guidelines (forward-backward translation, each step involving two different translators). This version will be tested in a group of ten health professionals (physicians and physiotherapists), ten subjects who had a stroke and ten caregivers, All participants will be asked to judge the clarity of each item of the scale, including scoring instructions, using a dichotomous response (clear/unclear). Items that are judged unclear by more than 20 percent of evaluators will be revised by the multidisciplinary translation team to produce the final mBI-Italian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final mBI-Italian will then be administered to a sample of at least 100 subjects with stroke to assess its metric properties in this population. Participants will be enrolled among patients admitted to the Don Gnocchi Foundation in Florence for stroke rehabilitation. To assess reliability, upon admission each patient will be independently assessed using the mBI-Italian by two examiners, drawn at random from a group of ten physiotherapists. One of the two raters will administer the scale twice on consecutive days. Other evaluators will administer other clinical scales (Fugl-Meyer assessment, FMA; modified Rankin scale, mRS) to assess the validity of the mBI-Italian. All raters will be blinded to all other assessments and to their previous assessment, if any. All the scales will be administered again at discharge, when participants will also be asked to indicate the perceived change since admission in their ability to autonomously manage the basic activities of daily living (ADLs). For the latter, a 7-points Global Rating of Perceived Change (GRPC) Lickert scale will be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cronbach's alpha will be used to estimate the internal consistency of the scale. To assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC1,1), Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM) and Minimal Detectable Change with 95% Confidence (MDC95) will be computed. Criterion and construct validity will be assessed by computing the association between the mBI-Italian and the FMA and the mRS, at both admission and discharge. For responsiveness, the following indices will be calculated: 1) Guyatt Responsiveness Index (GRI); 2) Standardized Response Mean (SMR), both in the whole sample and in subgroups of participants with different outcome (improved, unchanged, worsened) based on the GPRC; 3) Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). The latter will be derived using the ROC curve approach, using the patient's perceived change in his/her autonomy in basic ADLs as an anchor.\n",

      "This trial will be initiated to explore whether RBX2660 (REBYOTA®) could be suitable for administration by the practice of colonoscopy. More specifically, the purpose of this trial is to explore the safety and clinical effectiveness of RBX2660 when delivered by colonoscopy to adults with rCDI. The experience of physicians will be documented through a physician-experience questionnaire to explore the usability of RBX2660 in clinical practice for colonoscopic administration. Furthermore, to explore the patient-experience of RBX2660 treatment, each trial subject will be offered to undergo a structured interview.\n",

      "The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about a pneumococcal vaccine with a new ingredient (PF-07872411) intended to enhance the effects of the vaccine. This pneumococcal vaccine with the new ingredient may prevent the diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria like meningitis, sepsis, ear infections and sinusitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meningitis is an infection in which the tissue around the brain and spine is swollen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sepsis is a very serious infection in your blood caused by a germ (a bacteria). Sinusitis is when your sinuses (the air-filled spaces inside your nose and head), are infected.\n",
      "\n",
      "This study is seeking for healthy participants who:\n",
      "\n",
      "are above 50 years of age and less than 64 years of age.\n",
      "have not taken any vaccine for pneumococcal diseases before.\n",
      "have not taken any vaccines with additional ingredients within 1 year before administration of the study vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "All participants will receive a single study vaccine shot in the upper arm muscle at the study clinic. The study will compare the experiences of people receiving the vaccine with a new ingredient in the vaccine to those without the new ingredient. This will be done by comparing 2 different dose levels of the new ingredient. It will also be compared against people who receive the vaccine without the new ingredient and at different dose levels. This will help the study team establish if the vaccine with a new ingredient is safe and effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants will take part in this study for about 12 months. During this time participants will have up to 6 clinic visits. At these clinic visits, participants will be asked if any side effects were experienced. The participants will also have to give blood samples during these visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some participants will need to have blood taken for laboratory tests before they can be judged to be eligible to be included in the study.\n",

      "The healthcare professional will advise patients about the study, and with their permission refer them to research staff for recruitment. Should patients choose to participate in the study they will be asked to provide consent to have a few drops of blood sample obtained through a finger prick to be used in the POCT. POCT results will not be provided to participants and this will be explained in both the recruitment script and informed consent form. A sample of 5 to 10 ml venous whole blood will also be obtained for the conventional syphilis serology testing which is part of the routine for care of the four categories of patients (regardless of this research). This research will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes and will be on top of the regular care that patients will receive in the clinic. Upon completing the tests, participants will be asked to complete a brief feedback survey to assess patients' acceptability of syphilis POCT.\n",

      "This is a pilot study to determine the effectiveness of an emergency department re-evaluation software, to improve patient flow through an emergency department. The end goal of the study is to provide proof of the efficacy of the software and provide data such that the software can be improved upon. The study will include ED waiting room patients. The study will involve interaction with the software on a tablet for patients and software on a desktop for providers. The providers utilizing the software will not be considered part of the study, but rather focusing on the outcomes of the patients using the software. Patients will be selected by the provider as available for re-evaluation. Each patient will then be randomized into either a control group (software not used) and a \"study\" group (software used). Data analysis will be performed in conjunction with clinical statisticians at our institution. The risks of this study are primarily derived from patient privacy concerns, which have been addressed in the risk section.\n",

      "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the outcomes of vacuum assisted closure device versus conventional bolster dressing in securing split thickness skin graft in traumatic wounds; with emphasis on percentage of graft take and postoperative complications like hematoma, seroma and infection of graft site. Two groups were formed with 70 patients in each group. Patients were randomly allocated either to group A(VAC group) or group B(bolster dressing group) and outcomes were assessed on 5th post-operative day when first dressing change was done\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "This randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Dr. Ruth K.M. Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi from 21st October 2021 to 20th June 2022. Before conducting the study, ethical approval was obtained from Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) (IRB-2125/DUHS/Approval/2021/637).\n",
      "\n",
      "All patients were enrolled via non-probability consecutive sampling. The sample size for the current study was calculated as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mean graft take for VAC group = 96 ±6 Mean graft take for conventionally treated group = 89±20 (10) Level of confidence = 95% Power = 80% A sample of 140 patients (70 per group) was required to detect mean difference of 7 in graft take between two groups as estimated by using the above parameters through online available calculator Open Epi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients visiting outpatient department and requiring skin graft were admitted to Plastic surgery and recruited into the study with their consent. Study purpose and risk and benefits associated with the procedure were explained to the patient to obtain their consent. Total 70 patients in each group, meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated either to the conventional group or new technique group. Random allocation of patients was done using the SNOSE (sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope) protocol. Total 140 sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes was prepared enclosing the group name with half of the envelop will be enclosing name of group A (VAC group) and other half enclosing the group b (bolster dressing group) and after that envelops was shuffled to ensure randomization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin grafting was performed under general anesthesia. Humby's knife was used to harvest skin graft from donor site. Skin graft was hand meshed and secured to the recipient site circumferentially with absorbable sutures, followed by Tincture of benzoin soaked paraffin gauze layer. For the bolster dressing group, the recipient site was bolstered with wet bulky cotton gauze dressing and wrapped with cotton bandage. 0.9% normal saline was used for moisture. For the Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) Group, two sheets of sterilized VAC sponge that was cut to fit the wound contour were placed with a fenestrated tube between the two layers that was secured to the surrounding skin using tincture of benzoin spray and an adhesive dressing (OPSITE). The VAC was placed at -125mmHg suction and checked for any air leak. Any loss of suction was treated by reinforcing the adhesive dressing over the air leak. The VAC was decompressed and clamped till the patient is shifted back to the ward. Once in ward, The VAC was placed to intermittent -125 mmHg suction for 2 hours and then decompressed for next 2 hours. Bed rest, sling or splint was used for immobilization depending on the location of injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients were permitted for slight movement for personal hygiene reasons. First dressing change was done on 5th post-operative day. They underwent early change of dressing in case excessive soakage of dressing with blood, serous fluid or foul smelling discharge or pus was present. Dressing of patient was opened on 5th operative day by researcher and then assessed by supervising consultant for percentage of skin graft take and post-operative complications. A pre-designed proforma was designed to collect the data. Patients' data was kept confidential. Medical record no. of patients was tagged with other serial number to assure the confidentiality of the data and only principal investigator had an access to original data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 21. Qualitative variables like gender, socioeconomic status, place of residence, smoking status, medical comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension), graft site, donor site, post-operative complications were presented as frequency with percentages. Quantitative variables such as age, height, weight, BMI, graft size, length of stay in the hospital, percentage of graft take were summarized in terms of mean standard deviation. Effect-modifiers such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, graft site, graft size, diabetes and hypertension will be controlled through stratification. Post-stratification independent t-test or Mann Whitney U test will be applied to compare percentage of graft take among two treatment groups. Post-stratification chi-square test will be applied to assess difference of post-operative complications among two treatment groups. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n",

      "Study Design The study is a single-centre double-blinded sham-controlled randomized trial. All patients have the same baseline characterization. Patients and researchers will be blinded to allocation in trial. Before randomization patients will have an additional meal test performed addressing metabolic characterization of the incretine hormones at baseline. Patients will afterwards be allocated to either the group receiving G-POEM or to the control group where a sham procedure consisting of a gastroscopy with biopsy during general anaesthesia will be done. The randomization will be carried out per-operatively. A computer-generated bloc randomization with sizes of four will be applied. The study will consist of 5 study visits, with a follow-up of 90 days after procedure. Symptoms and adverse event will be monitored 7, 30, and 90 days after intervention. During the 90-day follow-up all primary and secondary outcome will be reassessed.\n",

Procedures will be performed by experienced surgeons from the Gastro Unit at Hvidovre Hospital,who postoperatively will have no contact with the research team or study participants. Patients will receive the same care during hospitalization.\n",

After identifying problems with use and completing a follow-up, 3 months of educational intervention (Lectures) among professionals was given. As this study is observational informed consent from all subjects was waived. The subjects were enrolled on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients receiving at least 7 days of Valproic acid, between 10-70 years old, both sexes, were included in the study figure 1. 600 Prescriptions were reviewed between January of 2015 to December of 2017 for patients who were suffering from any psychotic illness and were on psychiatric medications. Then patient were educated and followed up for six months.\n",

      "Inclusion/ exclusion criteria: The study population was limited to those who were continuously eligible for the outpatient during the entire study period. Patients were identified through pharmacy drug prescriptions By hospital policy all drugs are prescribed for a maximum period of 3 months. Consequently, all patients presented at least twice during the study period. A designed and structured form was used to collect the required information. Data then collected on Microsoft Excel sheet, which included patients' initial therapeutic indications, concomitant use of oral medications, significant adverse drug effects and any drug -drug interaction.\n",

      "The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of live lullaby from mother voice, and breast milk smell on pyhsiological parameters, comfort and maternal attachment levels of preterm newborns who are between 35-37 weeks of gestation at the time of the study and the level of pospartum depression of mothers. The main hypothesis are:\n",
      "\n",
      "H0: The live lullaby from mother voice and breast milk smell have no effects on pyhsiological parameters, comfort and maternal attachment levels of preterm newborns H1: The live lullaby from mother voice has effects on pyhsiological parameters, comfort and maternal attachment levels of preterm newborns H2: The breast milk smell has effects on pyhsiological parameters, comfort and maternal attachment levels of preterm newborns H3: There is differences between the live lullaby from mother voice and the breast milk smell interventions in terms of preterm newborns' physiological parameters, comfort and maternal attachment levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "H4: The postpartum depression level of mothers in experimental groups (lullaby group and breast milk group) is lower than the control group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants will be in three groups according to the interventions. The preterm newborns who are going to listen a live lullaby from their mothers' voice will be the first group (Lullaby group). The preterms in the second group (Breast milk group) are going to smell their mothers' breast milk. The preterms in the third group (Control group) are going to recieve rutin nursing care interventions.\n",

      "Declines in cognitive function and walking function are highly intertwined in older adults. A therapeutic approach that combines complex (cognitively engaging) aerobic walking exercise with non-invasive electrical brain stimulation may be effective at restoring lost function. This study tests whether electrical stimulation of prefrontal brain regions is more beneficial than sham stimulation.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with complex (cognitively engaging) walking exercise in older adults. The primary outcome measures are executive function (computer-based assessment battery) and complex walking function (speed on an obstacle negotiation task). This will be a two-site trial conducted at the University of Florida (lead site) and Brooks Rehabilitation Hospital, which is necessary to achieve enrollment targets and will allow us to develop a multi-site research infrastructure for a future Phase 3 multi-site trial. The study will enroll up to 120 older adult women and men, who exhibit mild to moderate decline of executive function. All experimental groups will receive the same complex walking intervention, which will focus on use of cognitively engaging tasks such as obstacle crossing, accurate foot placement, and walking on complaint surfaces. Each session will consist of 30 minutes of walking. For tDCS, the active treatment group will receive 20 minutes of 2mA tDCS over prefrontal regions F3/F4 (\"treatment group\"). The second group is a sham control group. tDCS will be delivered simultaneously with complex walking exercise for 18 sessions over a 6-week period. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post intervention (within one week), and 12 weeks post-intervention.\n",

      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of bleeding. Paradoxically, ITP is also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies showed that the occurrence of thrombosis in patients with ITP is not purely accidental and can be considered a clinical reality with an important impact on the management of the disease (2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathophysiological mechanism for thrombosis in ITP remains unclear. Sever bleeding episodes are relatively rare in some patients with ITP although having low platelet count, suggests that these patients may have a protective factor against bleeding (3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies with high affinity for phospholipids such lupus anticoagulant (LA), β2glycoprotien І (β2GPІ), and anticardiolipin (anti-CL). They interfere with physiological mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis, leading the haemostatic balance towards coagulation. Moreover, it seems to affect the physiological function of various cells such as platelets and endothelial cells (4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Microparticles (MPs) are a diverse group of bioactive small-sized vesicles (100-1000nm) that can be found in body fluids and blood after activation, necrosis, or apoptosis of almost all cells. Although most MPs in human blood originate from platelets, MPs are also released from leukocytes, erythrocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cancer cells (5). They participate in intercellular communication and play a major role in homeostasis under physiological conditions and also in diseases (6). The most prominent property of MPs is their procoagulant potential, mainly based on phosphatidylserine exposure and tissue factor expression (7).\n",
      "\n",
      "Elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies and microparticles have been reported as a risk for development of prothrombotic state (8).\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, with 9% to 23% of patients experiencing pelvic sidewall lymph node metastasis. According to the current Chinese guidelines for diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer, pelvic sidewall lymph node dissection is recommended for patients who have experienced or are suspected of having lateral lymph node metastasis. Lateral lymph node dissection can result in longer operation times, increased bleeding, and complications such as urinary and sexual dysfunction after surgery. Currently, the presence of metastasis is primarily determined by the size and enhancement characteristics of lateral lymph nodes observed through imaging studies. However, the pathological lymph node metastasis rate of specimens collected after lateral lymph node dissection based on current imaging criteria is only 20.5%. Therefore, a pressing clinical challenge is accurately determining the presence of lateral lymph node metastasis and avoiding unnecessary lateral lymph node dissection in patients who have not experienced lateral lymph node metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been widely used in clinical practice. It has replaced traditional lymph node dissection in some breast cancer and melanoma patients, reducing surgical risks and complications and improving patients' quality of life. This study aims to use indocyanine green as a tracer for fluorescence-guided laparoscopic navigation to locate the lateral sentinel lymph nodes of rectal cancer in the pelvic cavity. By studying the accuracy, specificity, and false-negative rate of predicting lateral lymph node status using the sentinel lymph node, we can further clarify the clinical significance of the lateral sentinel lymph node.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "This study is a prospective single-arm clinical study. 87 patients with middle and low rectal cancer are planned to be included in the study. After general anesthesia during the operation, indocyanine green is injected around the tumor through the anus. After the sentinel lymph nodes are developed and located by fluorescent laparoscopy, they are removed and sent to rapid frozen pathological examination, and then the lateral lymph nodes are cleaned. Through pathological examination and statistical analysis of the fluorescent stained lateral sentinel lymph nodes and all the cleaned lateral lymph nodes, To evaluate the clinical significance of lateral sentinel lymph nodes located by this technique in predicting the status of lateral lymph nodes.\n",

For body acupuncture, a 0.3 mm×40 mm needle was used to insert directly for 0.5-1.0 cun, and twisting to gain the qi; for auricular points, a 0.25 mm×40 mm needle was used for 2-3 minutes without manipulating the needle. The acupuncture points were retained for 30 min, and the treatment was performed once every other day, three times a week, and the curative effect was evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with aerobic exercise in non-specific low back pain patients. The main question aims to answer: • Which are the effects of tDCS treatment combined with aerobic exercise compared to Sham tDCS combined with aerobic exercise in non-specific Low Back Pain? Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and they will receive treatments as tDCS or Sham tDCS and aerobic exercise (treadmill walking). Researchers will compare a group who is treated with a combination of tDCS and aerobic exercise versus a group receiving placebo tDCS and aerobic exercise to see the effects on pain intensity, pressure pain, disability, kinesiophobia, quality of life, catastrophism, Heart Rate Variability and cortical excitation.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability worldwide with a prevalence of 70 to 85% of the population. Chronic LBP (CLBP) is defined as a pain lasting more than 12 weeks. CLBP does not have peripheral nociceptive stimuli, but it is characterized by the presence of a chronic change in neuroplasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of therapeutic intervention that can modulate the cortical excitability of a wide neural network involved in the elaboration of pain, resulting in an efficacy option for CLBP treatment. Aerobic exercise represents another typology of effective therapeutic intervention in the treatment of pain intensity and disability related to CLBP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise compared to shame/placebo tDCS combined with aerobic exercise in middle-aged subjects with non-specific CLBP in the short, medium and long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods: In a double-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial, 38 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years, with a diagnose of non-specific LBP for 3 months, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) result of >20mm and a Roland-Morris Scale result of >4 will be selected for the following study. Participants will be divided in two groups of 19 subjects each one: experimental group A (20 minutes of tDCS at 2 mili Amper + 20-30 minutes of aerobic exercise at 60-80% of HRmax) and controlled group B (30 seconds of sham/placebo tDCS at 2milli amperes + 20-30 minutes of aerobic exercise at 60-80% of maximum heart rate). The following outcomes will be measured: pain intensity (100mm VAS), pressure pain (pressure algometer), disability (Roland-Morris questionnaire), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia), quality of life (SF-12 health questionnaire), catastrophism (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), Heart Rate Variability ( Polar Team) and cortical excitation (Critical Flicker Fusion).\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "This clinical trial evaluates the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using daily adaptive radiation techniques to the prostate fossa and/or pelvic lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer who have undergone surgical removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy). For patients with prostate cancer who develop a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy is the standard of care treatment. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. All patients receiving salvage radiation following radical prostatectomy typically have treatment directed to the prostate fossa, which is the anatomical region around the operative bed that is at highest risk for containing left over tumor. Many patients receiving salvage radiation therapy can also benefit from treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes. Adaptive radiotherapy is an emerging treatment technique that uses daily imaging to adjust treatment volumes, ensure accurate dose delivery, and allow the use of smaller planning target volume margins. Adaptive radiation is ideally suited for the further implementation of SABR treatment regimens directed to the prostate fossa with or without inclusion of the pelvic lymph nodes. While daily adaptive radiation therapy has been reported in other disease settings, there is currently no data about its use for post-prostatectomy radiation. Using daily adaptive radiation techniques may help researchers learn how to minimize exposure to normal tissue and shorten the number of required treatments to better target the radiation dose in prostate cancer patients post-prostatectomy.\n",

The EQ-5D-Y descriptive system will be used to assess the following five dimensions: mobility, looking after myself, doing usual activities, having pain or discomfort and feeling worried, sad or unhappy. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems and a lot of problems. The associated Visual Analog Scale (from 0 - the worst health to 100 - the best health) can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the younger patient's own judgement.\n",

      "The goal of this observational study is to improve the intraoperative diagnosis accuracy of invasiveness for small-sized lung adenocarcinoma by combining multi-modal information. The main question it aims to answer is whether multi-modal information have great value of prediction on the invasiveness for small-sized lung adenocarcinoma. Since a promising limited resection is largely based on intraoperative frozen section diagnosis, there is a growing demand on the high-accuracy of timely pathology diagnosis. The multi-modal information of participants will be collected retrospectively.\n",

      "This is a single-centre, open-label, fixed-sequence trial to evaluate the influence of C21 on the exposure of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and P-gp substrates in healthy male and female volunteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial consists of a screening phase (Day -28 to Day -1), an open-label intervention phase (Day -1 to Day 19), and a follow-up phase (Day 20 to Day 25 [±2 days]). Subjects will remain at the trial site from the afternoon of Day -1 to the morning of Day 6, and again from the afternoon of Day 16 to the morning of Day 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intervention phase consists of 3 periods: in period 1 (Day -1 to Day 3), the pharmacokinetics (PK) of all substrates will be evaluated in the absence of C21, in period 2 (Day 4 to Day 6), a potential inhibitory effect of C21 on the substrates be evaluated, and in period 3 (Day 17 to Day 19), the net effect of potential C21-mediated induction and inhibition on the substrates will be evaluated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subjects will be expected to attend a total of 4 visits to the trial site, including a screening visit (Visit 1), 2 intervention visits (Visits 2 and 3) and a follow-up visit (Visit 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Each subject is expected to participate in the trial for approximately 55 days, including an up to 28-day screening period, 19-day intervention period and a 4- to 8-day follow-up period.\n",

      "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) surgical simulators are increasingly being used for learner education. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of IVR to hands-on orthopaedic workshop sessions (such as arthroscopy simulators, cadaveric models, and Sawbones®) in various orthopaedic subspecialties (such as sports, arthroplasty, and spine surgery).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, in this multi-stage comprehensive randomized controlled the aim is to assess:\n",
      "\n",
      "If IVR simulation using head-mounted displays (HMD) is superior to the current standard of training for orthopaedic surgery residents and medical students.\n",
      "Determine if it is feasible to incorporate immersive headset virtual reality simulation into residency training programs and medical school curriculums.\n",

      "Study Stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 1 - Medical students and orthopaedic residents participating in the Canadian Orthopaedic Surgery Medical Education Course 2023 (COSMEC) will be selected and computer randomized (1:1) into two groups of experimental (IVR) and control (arthroscopy simulator box), based on level of training. Allocation concealment will be ensured using central randomization. Trainees in both groups will receive a common didactic training for knee arthroscopy. Subsequently, trainees in the experimental group will undergo a IVR surgical training module and trainees in the control group will undergo a similar module using arthroscopy simulator box. Following the training modules, participants will complete knowledge tests, technical skill assessments on knee arthroscopy simulators, and experiential surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 2 - Medical students and orthopaedic residents participating in the 2023 University of Toronto Orthopaedic Surgery bootcamp will be selected and computer randomized (1:1) into two groups of experimental (IVR) and control (sawbones), based on level of training. Allocation concealment will be ensured using central randomization. Trainees in both groups will receive a common didactic training for femoral intramedullary nail (IMN) placement. Subsequently, trainees in the experimental group will undergo a IVR surgical training module and trainees in the control group will undergo a similar module using Sawbones ®. Following the training modules, participants will complete knowledge tests, technical skill assessments on cadaveric models, and experiential surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 3 - The protocol explained in stage 1 and 2 may be repeated for various orthopaedic sub-speciality (including arthroplasty and spine surgery) for the participants in the booth camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 4 - All trainees may then be followed longitudinally over the course 6 months. Trainees' performance may be evaluated for procedures in which training was provided, based on preceptor evaluations (for example by completing standardised evaluation forms) on a voluntary basis.\n",

      "This study aims to assess the feasibility of an intervention for the management of craving, stress, anxiety, and depression among people who use opioids via a resonance breathing smartphone app.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Most evidence-based treatments for substance use disorders (SUD) require face-to-face interactions with individuals who comprise a recovery support network. However, in the moment relapse occurs, people in recovery are often not in the presence of these trusted individuals. This project aims to address this issue by providing people in recovery with an application (app) that can be added to phones and other mobile devices to help them manage cravings, anxiety, and stress triggers at the specific moments they feel compelled to use. The connection between an individuals mind and body works in both directions. Psychological distress can cause psychosomatic symptoms in the body (e.g., stress is related to multiple chronic health conditions), but individuals can also use their bodies to affect psychology aspects (e.g., exercise can improve mood by releasing endorphins). A similar scientific theory is the foundation of controlled breathing interventions for anxiety, stress, and drug cravings. Psychological distress can disrupt the balance of our Autonomic Nervous System (which is responsible for our fight or flight response to threat), but breathing exercises can restore balance and decrease stress. The goal of this study is to test the feasibility, utility, and efficacy of an app that delivers controlled breathing exercises.\n",

      "This intervention uses the Camera Heart Rate Variability (CHRV) smartphone application, a resonance breathing app that is available for download to iPhones and Android devices. The CHRV app uses Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure heart rate. PPG is a noninvasive technology that uses a light source (the phone's flashlight) and a photodetector (the phone's camera lens) at the surface of one's skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. The app also has a timer (to allow the participant to see how long they use the app in each session). The iPhone version of the app also has a breathing pacer (a bar that moves up and down to show the participant when to inhale and exhale). Participants are instructed to initiate a resonance breathing session for at least 5 minutes every day and whenever they experience cravings, feel like they are going to relapse, feel anxious or stressed, or just want to feel calm.\n",

      "The aim of the study is to evaluate the expression of Sodium Glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in myocardium from patients with aortic stenosis. 2 groups of patients will be defined: Group A with diastolic heart failure and Group B without heart failure. The expression of SGLT2 will be measured on small myocardium specimens harvested during aortic valve replacement operation. This study should allow us to better understand the effect of glifozines in human heart failure.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "In brief, the right management of complex or recurrent pilonidal disease (PD) is still controversial. In our institution we treat these conditions with Bascom's cleft lift surgery. Though this approach for most parts is beneficial, a large proportion of patients will suffer from prolonged post operative healing. We have published some positive results on treating non-healing postoperative wounds after cleft lift surgery with autologous fatty cell transplantation. The overall aim of the project is to investigate whether the addition of autologous fat cell transplantation in the surgical treatment of PD reduces the incidence of patients with prolonged postoperative healing. In a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial, we will investigate the effect of injections of freshly harvested autologous fatty cells in addition to Bascom's cleft lift operation versus Bascom's cleft lift operation alone.\n",

      "The overall aim of the project is to investigate whether the addition of autologous fatty cell transplantation in the surgical treatment of pilonidal disease (PD) reduces the incidence of patients with prolonged postoperative healing. In a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial, the investigators will investigate the effect of injections of freshly harvested autologous fatty cells in addition to Bascom's cleft lift operation versus Bascom's cleft lift operation alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators hypothesize that addition of autologous fatty cell injection to Bascom's cleft lift operation for pilonidal disease will reduce the proportion of patients with poor postoperative healing compared to patients in the control group who are treated with Bascom's cleft lift operation alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary endpoint of this study is healing of the pilonidal lesion (max 1 defect ≤5mm, no undermining) after 4 weeks and 12 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, symptom development, postoperative pain, complication rate, time to healing and recurrence rates are also explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pilonidal disease (PD) is a widespread disorder that occurs in the crena ani. A paradigm shift in our perception of the pathology causing this disorder has been coming for several decades and the treatment is slowly conforming to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The estimated incidence is 26-48 per 100,000, although globally there is great geographical variation (1). Men present with treatment-requiring pilonidal disease more than twice as often as women, and population studies of young students have found up to a 10:1 male/female ratio, including asymptomatic pilonidal cysts(2). In the investigators own material, the proportion of women are 17% of patients with complicated pilonidal disease (62/363). The disorder most often affects younger patients with an average age at first manifestation of 21 years for men and 19 for women (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Acute manifestations are infected cysts and results in the formation of pilonidal abscesses. The treatment of these is uncontroversial and is based on lateral incision and drainage with secondary open healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chronic pilonidal disease manifests itself in the formation of more or less widespread subcutaneous branching systems containing hair which is \"sucked\" into the system by negative pressure that occurs when changing position, especially from sitting to standing. The condition is characterized by pain and foul-smelling secretions and bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment of the chronic manifestations, as opposed to the acute abscesses, has been controversial and over the last 1-2 decades has gradually moved more towards lateralization techniques, the gap between the buttocks is (partially) levelled surgically and the suture line is placed outside the midline of the crena ani (3,4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bascom's cleft lift operation is one of several lateralization techniques that have shown promising results over the past decades (5-10). Nevertheless, in the hands of the investogators poor or delayed healing is found in up to a third of these otherwise young and healthy patients, which seems to be in line with the international literature (11). Many patients thus experience long outpatient courses postoperatively with several additional treatments such as regular surgical wound revision, treatment with various forms of negative pressure bandaging, steroid cream regimens or silvernitrate dressings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platelet-rich plasma therapy (BPT) is used with good effect as an addition to the surgical treatment of pilonidal disease, as BPT promotes angiogenesis, cell regeneration and thus promotes healing. A review finds a reduction in healing time of 36% in BPT-treated patients compared to the control group(12,13). Moreover, treatments with allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells are used in other healing-challenged areas, such as mb. Crohn's fistulas and burns (14-16). However, both treatments are both time-consuming and expensive, and the investigators believe that autologous fat cell transplantation is a faster and more affordable alternative, which a study in Mb. Crohn's patients with complicated peri-anal fistulas also support: Here, in a series of 21 patients healing was found in 57% (clinical and MR-verified) - a very satisfactory result in this context (17). The cell composition in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the harvested adipose tissue has been found to contain 10%-50% live stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells and 7%-30% endothelial cells (mature and stem cells) depending on where the fat is harvested and which method is used (18-20). This cell composition supports the healing potential in the treatment with autologous fatty cell transplantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the department of the investigators, a series of operations with autologous fatty cell injections for non-healing pilonidal wounds has been carried out with good results. Thus, in these highly selected patients, the investigators have a healing rate of 83% (69-96%) over a median time of 159 days. Two patients had recurrence (6.7%) (21).\n",
      "\n",
      "The method is minimally invasive and is combined in this study with Bascom's cleft lift (BCL) operation. The results seem promising with minimal risks and it could be an important supplement to the basic treatment of these patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) METHOD\n",
      "\n",
      "STUDYDESIGN:\n",
      "\n",
      "The study will be conducted as a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial that will compare healing after BLC surgery with injections of freshly harvested autologous adipose tissue versus BLC surgery alone. The trial is being conducted as a multicenter study, where patients are included at two centers in Denmark. The two centers are located at Randers Regional Hospital and Slagelse Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "SURGICAL PROCEDURE:\n",
      "\n",
      "Included patients will undergo BLC surgery according to standardized principles. Prior to surgery, the randomization is carried out using allocation tables in REDCap, where an equal distribution of patients in the intervention group and the control group is also ensured in each center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intervention group: Patients in the intervention group will undergo liposuction to harvest autologous fatty cells. The patient is placed in prone position. For the liposuction, a small incision is made bilaterally in the flanks. 2-300 ml of Ringer's acetate with 1 mg of added adrenaline is introduced with an infusion cannula fan-shaped into the subcutaneous adipose tissue on each side of the lumbar region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adipose tissue is harvested with an equal distribution on each side of the region for a total of approx. 80 ml. 20 ml Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml is distributed on each side of the lower back after harvesting the fatty cells. The incisions are then closed with Steri-Strips and a compressive dressing is applied to reduce the risk of hematoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adipose tissue is then prepared: The harvested adipose tissue is distributed equally in 10 ml syringes and centrifuged in bulks of four at 1000 rpm. minute for 3 minutes. The liquid fraction is discarded. Using a three-way tap system, the adipose tissue is homogenized/microfragmented between two 10 ml syringes by moving the contents back and forth at least 20 times. The adipose tissue is then distributed in 2 ml syringes for injection. A total of between 25 and 55 ml of usable adipose tissue will be harvested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bascom cleft lift operation is performed as described in appendix 7. Before the cleft lift incision is sutured, the fatty tissue will be systematically injected with a sharp 1.2 mm needle and cover all the wound surfaces with 0.2-0.5 ml at a time. The procedure was published as a video vignette in 2019(22). Results from the first seven patients (2020) and the first 30 patients (2022) have been published (21,23).\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients in the control group: Control patients are given a sham, where a small incision is also made bilaterally in the lumbar region and 20 ml Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml is distributed on each side of the lower back. The incisions are then closed with Steri-Strips and compressive dressings are applied in the same way as the intervention group.\n",
      "\n",
      "COOPERATION PARTNERS:\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgeries will be performed by specialists in abdominal surgery with a sub-specialty within this type of surgery in two centres: Surgical Department at Randers Regionshospital and Slagelse Hospital. I. Faurschou at Randers Regionshospital, Region Midt, has the overall responsibility for the project with Supervisor Susanne Haas as the legally responsible person. The local manager at Slagelse Hospital is P. Maine. Those responsible at each site are responsible for inclusion and informing the patients, guided and supported by I. Faurschou.\n",
      "\n",
      "POST-OPERATIV FOLLOW-UP:\n",
      "\n",
      "The patients will have follow ups at 4 and 12 weeks after the operation, where the healing will be clinically assessed based on endpoints by project manager I. Faurschou, blinded to the randomisation. The control takes place by telephone consultation together with answering the symptom questionnaire and pain diary sent out automatically from REDCap® as well as weekly photo documentation of healing through Pleje.net® (Dansk Telemedicin A/S), with the option of immediate physical consultation within a week in case of lack of healing. Photos will be taken using the Pleje.net app weekly in relation to hair removal by a nurse/person who handles hair removal. Patients are given a guide to Pleje.net. On Pleje.net, a user group has been set up for each site, so only project managers can see all the patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is no healing after 12 weeks, the patient will be offered further treatment in line with our normal treatment practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample size: In a recent study, the investigators found somewhat surprisingly that only 12% of PS patients operated with BCL surgery were fully healed after 14 days (≤ 1 defect, ≤ 5 mm, no undermining). After 12 weeks, this proportion was 72%. The investigaros expect 50% of patients to have healed after 4 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using fatty cells in non-healing PS wounds, the investigators have a healing rate of 83% (69-96%) over a median time of 159 days. In combination with fatty cells, it is expected that 75% of patients have healed by 4 weeks. With a significance level of 5% (α) and a power of 80% (β), 66 patients will be included in each group (Fleiss with continuity correction). Assuming a dropout of 4 patients in each group, a total of 140 patients will be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interim analysis: Interim analysis: Halfway through the inclusion, an interim analysis will be carried out. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is set up, which will make a recommendation to the project managers on whether the study should continue as planned, be interrupted due to unintended side effects as a result of AFT, interrupted because the effect of AFT has been unequivocally established; or is interrupted because it will not be possible to see a difference if the study is continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) PATIENTS: The patients are referred to the investigators outpatient clinic and informed about the project if BCL surgery is needed (recurrent or complex disease). After reflection time, patients are included on the day of surgery, where they are randomised. After the operation, they will be followed in the outpatient 4 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively. If there is no healing after 12 weeks, the patient will be offered further treatment in line with our normal treatment practice.\n",

      "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency that can develop in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ACS is a type of limb ischemia, which means that the limb, such as the arm or leg, loses blood flow. Patients on ECMO can develop this condition for many reasons, but most commonly from the ECMO procedure itself. This most commonly involves the leg. Key symptoms of ACS include severe pain, loss of pulses, loss of feeling, and inability to move the limb. However, because patients on ECMO are often sedated, ACS is difficult to diagnose as patients can not report symptoms. As a result, the only available tool for diagnosing ACS may be measurement of pressures in the limb. This is normally done with a needle-device, which is inserted into the leg for a single measurement. However, a recently developed device, called the MY01 Continuous Compartment Pressure Monitor, allows for continuous pressure readings instead of a single measurement. Multiple measurements may allow for much greater accuracy in diagnosing ACS, which may result in faster time to surgery and potentially save more limbs than single measurements. This device may also be less invasive than an older method of continuous pressure measuring, which uses a needle and tubing that is 14-gauge in size. Therefore, this study aims to compare 3 different types of methods for diagnosing ACS in patients on ECMO, which are 1) Standard of Care, 2) Standard of Care and MY01, and 3)Standard of Care and 14-gauge slit catheter.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency that threatens limb viability and can develop in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ACS typically develops as a complication secondary to peripheral arterial cannulation and is more common in patients on peripheral veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. The pathophysiologic mechanism of ACS implicates a dramatic increase in compartmental pressures due to the non-compliance of the surrounding osteofascial structures. Without sufficient time for compensatory angiogenesis, the marked fluid extravasation and inflammation within the rigid compartment persists. This increase in pressure leads to compression of neurovascular structures, causing or further perpetuating any pre-existing limb ischemia. The underlying cause of the increased compartmental pressures may be due to a variety of causes in these ECMO patients without a history of trauma, such as ischemia and rhabdomyolysis due to direct disruption of arterial flow (i.e. arterial thromboembolism), obstruction of venous flow (i.e. deep vein thrombosis), direct hemorrhage into the compartment from coagulopathy, or reperfusion injury due to calcium overload and microvascular dysfunction. The treatment of ACS is timely (less than 6 hours from diagnosis) fasciotomy, which is limb-saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "In awake patients, ACS is a clinical diagnosis relying on medical history, visual examination, palpation of pulses, and symptoms of pallor, paresthesia, out-of-proportion pain with passive stretch, and paresis. Though more technically demanding perhaps, duplex/doppler ultrasound may also be employed as an imaging technique to visualize blood flow and characterize the extent of any obstruction underlying the ischemia. Since the mainstay of diagnosis remains to be the subjective pain of the patient, the diagnosis of ACS in ECMO patients is challenged by the fact that patients on ECMO are typically intubated and receiving sedative medications. Thus, compartment pressure measurements >30 mmHg may be the only available diagnostic finding in addition to clinical suspicion based on history and tense muscular compartments for diagnosing ACS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, the standard of care for measuring intracompartmental pressure has been using a needle compartment pressure measuring device (Ex. Stryker needle). Some institutions also use a continuous compartment pressure measuring device in the form of a 14-gauge slit catheter attached to a pressure transducer. The main drawback with utilizing the needle compartment measuring device is that it only provides a single time point recording and is difficult to employ for repetitive use. While using the 14-gauge catheter and transducer offers continuous monitoring, this method creates an additional line to manage for patients on ECMO and runs the risk of failing due to clot formation, especially in patients without anticoagulative measures. In summary, diagnosis of ACS in ECMO patients is challenging, and clinicians currently lack a method for accurate, reliable, and continuous measurement of intracompartmental pressure that is well-tolerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employing digital micro sensing technology, the MY01 Continuous Compartmental Pressure Monitor (NXTSens Inc., Montreal, Canada) is a high-precision, implantable device that can continuously measure intracompartmental pressure. Having shown over 600% improved accuracy when compared to standard compartment pressure measuring devices, this advanced sensory microsystem can provide pressures with an accuracy of ±0.008 mmHg, which are then relayed to a cloud storage database as well as the MY01 mobile application for easy accessibility. With such reliable and real-time continuous pressure monitoring, MY01 may be the optimal diagnostic tool for ACS in patients on ECMO and lead to more prompt, limb-saving surgical fasciotomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the MY01 device in conjunction with current standard of care will help identify which patients on VA-ECMO have ACS more precisely than current standard of care alone, which includes physical exam findings and single timepoint needle compartment measurement. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that the MY01 device will be less invasive and easier to use than previously described methods of continuous compartment pressure monitoring utilizing a 14-gauge slit catheter.\n",

      "In addition to standard of care, the MY01 device will be inserted by an orthopedic surgeon into the leg on the same side as the ECMO tubing. This will occur within 6 hours of the start of ECMO. Insertion of the device involves a needle, which is removed once the device is inserted. Monitoring of the device will occur as described by the device manufacturer, which includes a mobile application. If at any time the compartment pressures suggest that there may be ACS, an orthopedic surgeon will be called to perform a physical exam. If the physical exam supports the diagnosis of ACS, then an additional pressure measurement with a needle may be also taken to confirm the measurement. If the diagnosis of ACS is made, the decision to proceed with surgery, or fasciotomy, will be a joint decision made by entire team. Monitoring of with the device will be done for 24 hours. The device will be removed after 24 hours or if the diagnosis of ACS is made.\n",

      "For the 14-gauge slit catheter group, the exact same protocol will be followed as the MY01 group. The 14-gauge slit catheter consists of tubing that is 14-gauge in size, which is inserted into the leg with a needle. The needle will be removed once the tubing is inserted. The tubing is then connected to a monitor, which will display the pressure in the leg. Just like the MY01 group, the leg will be numbed and cleaned before the tube is inserted in the leg. Instead of the data being recorded on a mobile device, a nurse or nurse technician will document pressure readings every 4 hours for a total of 24 hours. Once monitoring is finished, the 14-gauge slit catheter will be removed from the leg.\n",

      "If assigned to standard of care, the participant will undergo monitoring within 1 hour of the start of ECMO. For standard of care group, this will involve monitoring the leg with the ECMO tubing with physical exam every 4 hours for the first 24 hours. This will be performed by a trained nurse. If at any time there is suspicion for ACS, the physical exam will be verified by an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon will decide if pressure measurements will be necessary. If so, then a single pressure measurement from each compartment will be taken with a needle device. If the ACS diagnosis is made, any further monitoring of that leg is stopped. The decision to proceed with surgery, or fasciotomy, will be a joint decision made by entire team, which includes surgeons and medical doctors. This is currently the standard of care at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "This three-armed, parallel-group, single-blind, multi-center randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic supplement compared with that of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in ameliorating alcohol craving and severity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in patients diagnosed with AUD after 2 weeks of in-patient detoxification. In addition, this study also compares the efficacy of probiotic supplement and ACT to mitigate common comorbid of AUD (such as depression and anxiety symptoms); changes in event-related potential (ERP) on electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring which indicate reduce alcohol craving; and depreciate the serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicating lowering of systemic inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In phase I of the study, 120 patients diagnosed with AUD (using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 5th Edition or DSM-5) and 120 healthy controls will be recruited. The measured outcomes to be compared between patients with AUD and healthy non-AUD controls include ERP on EEG monitoring, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and the fecal microbiota content. Then, in phase II of the study, 120 AUD patients will be randomized into three groups of intervention in a 1:1:1 ratio (Lactobacillus sp. probiotic, ACT and placebo group; n = 40 per group). The participants in probiotic and placebo groups will then consumed the Lactobacillus sp. Probiotic and placebo 1 sachet once a day of probiotic and placebo, respectively for 12 weeks. While participants in ACT group will undergo training for ACT one session per week for 8 weeks. Outcome assessments will be performed across four time points, such as t0 = before intervention began, t1 = 8 weeks after intervention began, t2 = 12 weeks after intervention began, and t3 = 24 weeks after intervention began. The primary outcomes to be measured are the degree of alcohol craving, alcohol withdrawal, and severity of alcohol use disorder. While the secondary outcomes to be assessed are severity of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), changes in ERP on EEG monitoring, and fecal microbiota content.\n",

      "In order to monitor adverse effect (AE) during the trial, all participants will be given a trial card which contains the name, contact number and email of the members of the research team. They are encouraged to contact the research team member in charge if there is any occurrence of AE. The occurrence of AE will then be reported to the \"adverse effect\" section of the trial's case report form. The AE which may lead to withdrawal of participants from the trial are: (1) adverse reaction which is not related to the study intervention but cause discomfort to the participants, (2) adverse reaction which is related to the study intervention (probiotic, ACT and/or placebo), and (3) any changes in behavior, temperament, personality, psychotic symptoms, and suicidal tendency that occurred after the study intervention began (probiotic, ACT and/or placebo). All AE should be reported to the Human Research Ethics Committee of Xinxiang Medical University and Universiti Sains Malaysia and investigation should be carried out.\n",

      "In this study, the participants will be recruited from the source population. The source population is all the patients who registered under the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University (XXMU), China and Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic of Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia with alcohol-related mental illness. Advertisement with posters will be placed on display in the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of XXMU, the Department of Psychiatry, XXMU, and Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia to help in the recruitment of subjects. In this study, patients with alcohol dependence who met the diagnostic criteria of \"alcohol use disorder\" in DSM-5 were selected as the experimental group. Healthy people who met WHO healthy drinking standards or did not drink were used as the healthy control group. Then, baseline assessment (t0) will commence followed by admission of the experimental group subjects for initial 2 weeks for detoxification (routine treatment). The assessment for experimental group subjects include Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores, ERP analysis, serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and fecal microbiota analysis. While the assessment for healthy controls include ERP analysis, serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and fecal microbiota analysis. During detoxification, treatment of withdrawal symptoms mainly with benzodiazepine replacement therapy, while adequate supplementation of B vitamins, strengthening symptomatic supportive treatment, and corresponding antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants or emotional stabilizers were given according to the condition. Benzodiazepines are gradually discontinued after withdrawal symptoms resolved. Then, subjects in the experimental group will be randomized into three groups, such as probiotics + routine treatment group, placebo + routine treatment group, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) + routine treatment group. Specific intervention will be administered in the respective groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The estimated sample size needed for comparing the fecal microbiota, the serum cytokines, and the EEG and physiological indicators between subjects with alcohol use disorder and healthy controls was computed using the G*Power calculator 3.1.9.7 for calculating mean differences between two independent groups, whereby type I error = 0.05, power = 0.8, allocation ratio = 1:1, and effect size = 0.4 [De Giani et al. (2020)]. The estimated sample size needed was 120 subjects per group (inclusive of 20% of drop out). The estimated sample size needed for the experimental subject was calculated using the G*Power calculator 3.1.9.7 for calculating sample size for repeated measure ANOVA, within-between interaction, wherein type I error = 0.05, power = 0.8, number of groups = 3, number of measurements = 3, effect size = 0.15 [Kazemi et al. (2019)]. The estimated sample size needed was 120 subjects, 40 subjects per group (inclusive of 30% drop out).\n",

The eligible AD patients will be randomized 1:1:1 ratio to the three arms of the study according to a computer generated, blocked randomization list. The eligible patients will be assigned to the probiotics group, ACT group, and control group with a treatment code concealed in a closed envelope. The randomization will be performed by the study statistician, who had no contact with the patients and not involve in the research project. The statistician is trained to randomize subjects who first enrol in the study into the three groups using computer system for randomization purpose. The allocation sequence will not be available to any member of the research team until databases had been completed and locked. Data collection will be performed by research assistants who were not involved in the study and do not know the objectives of the study.

      "All data analysis will be performed using SPSS software version 26.0. Descriptive statistics for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, CIWA-Ar), PACS, AUDIT, HAMD, and HAMA scores, ERP analysis, and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels will be computed. All categorical variables will be presented in frequency and percentage, while all continuous variables will be reported in mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, depends on normality. Initially, the ERP, fecal microbiota content, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) will be compared between the experimental subjects and the healthy controls. The serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) will be compared using independent t-test (if data normally distributed) or Mann-Whitney U test (if data non-normally distributed). The mean difference in the primary outcome (CIWA-Ar, PACS, and AUDIT scores) for the three randomized groups (ACT, probiotic, and palcebo groups) at each specific time point (pre-intervention, 2 weeks at completion of conventional treatment [t0], post-treatment at 8 weeks [t1], post-treatment at 12 weeks [t2], and post-treatment at 24 weeks [t3]) will be assessed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by false discovery rate adjustment. For the main pool analysis, mixed ANOVA is used to determine the interaction between the groups (ACT, probiotic, and placebo groups) and time points on the primary outcome; interaction = intervention × time; where time is a within-subject variable and intervention effect is a between-subject variable). The main effects of intervention in the groups and time points will be presented as estimated marginal mean and standard error of mean. The study's primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The data analysis for the study's secondary outcomes (severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, pro-inflammatory cytokines, EEG characteristics, and fecal microbiota) will be conducted similarly to the primary outcomes' calculation. Statistical significance will be two-tailed and set to p < 0.05.\n",

If the missing data represent more than 5% but less than 40% of the total collected and are assumed to be randomly missing, then multiple imputation (restricted maximum likelihood estimation) will be performed using Stata 15. However, if the missing data represent more than 40% of the total collected data or are assumed to be missing either not randomly or completely randomly, then only the collected data will be used for the study's analysis, and the missing data will be explained as a research limitation in any publications of the study's findings.\n",

A piece of rice paper is floated on water surface in a lavatory bowl. Using the spatula attached to the tube cover, two spatula portions of the feces defecated on the rice paper are collected. Fecal specimens should not be contaminated with water, urine, barium, or mineral oil. Spatula is put back into the fecal collection tube and capped tightly. Then put into ziplock bag, sealed, stored in -80℃ (if possible, can be quick-frozen liquid nitrogen). Fecal sample collection must be completed within one week, upon receiving the fecal collection tube and rice paper. A picture instruction leaflet will be provided prior to fecal collection.\n",

      "BriefSummary\n",
      "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of using walking aid during out-of-bed mobilization of patients who underwent open coronary artery bypass graft surgery on levels of pain and mobility. The main hypotheses are:\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain level of patients using walking aid is lower than that of those who do not.\n",
      "The mobility level of patients using walking aid is higher than that of those who do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants will be asked to walk with using a walking aid during the first three mobilizations in the intensive care unit on the first postoperative day.\n",
      "Field\n",
      "DetailedDescription\n",
      "Group allocation of the patients was done through using Random Allocation Software program and patients were allocated into two groups: the intervention group and the control group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients in the intervention group were asked to o walk with using a walking aid during the first three mobilizations in the intensive care unit on the first postoperative day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researcher visited the patients in the CICU on the first day after surgery informed them that they were going to be mobilized out of the bed and walk in the room for two rounds (approximately 24 meters) for three times following each 4 hours by using a walking aid. The patients in the control group were informed that they were to be mobilized out of the bed and walk in the room for two rounds (approximately 24 meters) for three times following each 4 hours with the help of two nurses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the intervention group, to perform the first out-of-bed mobilization, the researcher and one other nurse supported helped the patient to straightening up in bed and then to sit in the bed. Then, the patient sat on the edge of the bed with their feet dangling outside. Following, with the brakes closed on the walking aid, the patient stood up from the bed and walked two rounds in the CICU room. The patient was then helped back to sit on the edge of the bed, and was asked to mark the level of pain and difficulty experienced during each activity on a horizontal line in the patient mobility scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Patient Mobility Scale scale was developed to measure the pain and difficulty levels experienced by patients during four activities (turning from one side to the other/straightening up in bed, sitting on the edge of the bed, standing up from the bed, and walking in the room) in the postoperative period. To evaluate pain, patients are asked to mark their level of pain for each activity on a line ranging from 0-\"no pain\" to 5-\"worst pain imaginable.\" To evaluate difficulty, patients are asked to mark their perceived difficulty for each activity on a line ranging from 0-\"very easy\" to 5-\"very difficult\". The total score of the patient mobility scale is derived by summing the pain and difficulty scores for all activities, with the lowest possible score being 0 and the highest score being 120. A lower score signifies that patients experienced less pain and difficulty during their activities, indicating a higher mobility level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the control group, to perform the first out-of-bed mobilization, the researcher and one other nurse supported helped the patient to straightening up in bed and then to sit in the bed. Then, the patient sat on the edge of the bed with their feet dangling outside. Following, two nurses helped the patient stood up from the bed and walk two rounds in the CICU room. The patient was then helped back to sit on the edge of the bed and was asked to mark the level of pain and difficulty experienced during each activity on a horizontal line in the patient mobility scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four hours after the first and second mobilizations, both groups of patients underwent a new mobilization procedure, and the interventions applied during the first mobilization were repeated.\n",
